His wife Hsu Chen-wei (徐榛蔚) was selected as the party's candidate for that seat in the 2018 elections and is now the incumbent county magistrate.The strong backing for Fu's election Saturday to the KMT Central Standing Committee was driven largely by his support for the party's Chairman Eric Chu (朱立倫), according to a party member, who spoke on condition of anonymity.As the KMT prepares for the local government elections in November, Fu has been assigned to several campaign posts, the party member said.Another KMT member said Fu's strong win indicated vibrant grassroots support, which will serve him well in his efforts to organize the party's campaign and negotiate between potential KMT candidates in the local government elections.Apart from Fu, six other incumbent legislators were among the 29 people elected Saturday to the KMT Central Standing Committee.Other candidates who gained high numbers of votes were Nantou County Councilor Yu Hao (游顥) (1,086), former Tainan County Council Deputy Speaker Chen Tsung-hsing (陳宗興) (1,049), and Legislator-at-Large Wu I-ding (吳怡玎) (987), according to the KMT.The newly elected Central Standing Committee members are expected to take up their posts on March 9.\n","(By Liu Kuan-ting and Kay Liu) \n","Enditem/pc\n","\n","Taiwan fundraiser for Ukrainian refugees collects NT$214 million in 3 days=Taipei, March 5 (CNA) A government-back campaign in Taiwan has raised NT$214 million (US$8.56 million) in three days, for assistance to displaced Ukrainians, amid an invasion of their country by Russia, the Relieve Disaster Foundation (RDF) said Saturday.Since a special bank account was set up at Land Bank of Taiwan at 2 p.m. on March 2, donations of NT$165 million have been received, while NT$49 million has been raised on the crowd-funding website WaBay, the RDF said, citing figures valid as of 4:30 p.m. Saturday.The funds will be used by Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) to provide medical aid, shelter, and relief supplies to Ukrainians displaced by the ongoing war in their country, said the foundation, which was commissioned by MOFA to manage the fundraising campaign.Last Wednesday, President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文), Vice President Lai Ching-te (賴清德), and Premier Su Tseng-chang (蘇貞昌) all pledged to donate one month's salary to the relief efforts for Ukraine.Meanwhile, 27 tons of medical supplies donated by Taiwan to Ukraine arrived in Poland on Friday and have been handed over to the Governmental Strategic Reserves Agency in Warsaw, which will assist in transferring the shipment to Ukraine, according to MOFA.Citing the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR, the foreign ministry said over 1 million Ukrainians had fled to neighboring countries, including Poland and Slovakia, in the past week.People who wish to donate to the Relieve Disaster Foundation effort can do so at Land Bank of Taiwan, bank code 005, account number 102-005-124-619, or on the crowd-funding website WaBay at https://wabay.tw/projects/twuk, the foundation said.\n","(By Lai Yu-chen and Kay Liu) \n","Enditem/pc\n","> Chinese Version\n","\n","400 reservists report for Army's 'toughest' training program=Taoyuan, March 6 (CNA) Around 400 reservists reported for duty at an elementary school in northern Taiwan's Taoyuan City on Saturday to begin a new, more intensified reservist training regimen dubbed the \"toughest ever\" in the nation, as the government tries to improve the combat readiness of the reserve forces amid rising cross-strait tension.After reporting to the Shanjiao Elementary School in Taoyuan's Lujhu District, the reservists began a 14-day program simulating a scenario of defending a beach near New Taipei City's Linkou District (林口) should a war break out, according to the Ministry of National Defense (MND).During the two weeks of training, all reservists would train for 10 hours a day, including a two-hour nighttime session, for a total of 136 hours, with no days off.They will only be allowed to use their mobile phone twice a day, from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. and from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m., the MND said.Reservists will also spend more time on required combat training, such as shooting pistols, rifles and machine guns, to maintain their basic combat skills.They will also undergo a 10-kilometer march loaded with full gear.Compared with the previous format when reservists report to a nearby military base for such training, this time they will be spending part of their time camping outdoors.Photo courtesy of the Military News AgencyThe MND said culinary specialists in the military will be cooking meals for them. They will also be provided with dried rations and ready-to-eat meal packages.The training schedule -- described by local media as \"the toughest reservist training in history\" -- was intimidating to many.However, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia demonstrates that tougher reservist training is necessary, according to Chen Ming-chung (陳明中), a 49-year-old ex-Army Major who has served 20 years in the military before retiring five years ago.Chen is the highest ranking reservist among the 400.\"Somebody has to operate weapon systems should a war break out and since we are here, we might as well make the most of the training sessions,\" Chen told reporters.Another reservist who refused to be named said the war in Ukraine made him believe that it is good to refamiliarize himself with how to fire a weapon.He, however, said 14 days, which is about twice as long as the usual reservist training program, is too long.Meanwhile, a reservist surnamed Peng (彭) was sent off by his girlfriend, who had tears in her eyes as the two said good-bye.\"I will miss him dearly,\" the girlfriend told reporters.Peng said he felt \"unfortunate\" to be called up as he was only discharged from the military a year ago and has just landed a stable job.The new regimen will be tested for the first three quarters of 2022 on around 15,000 reservists at 24 battalions and one company around Taiwan, according to the MND.The military will conduct a review of the new program in the fourth quarter of this year to see if it is generating the desired results before it decides whether to utilize it for future training.In the meantime, another 97,000 reservists will still be trained under the existing five-to-seven-day program, he said.The new reservist training program was devised after the military said in 2020 that it wanted to ensure that Taiwan's reserve force can more reliably back up regular forces in protecting the country amid increased Chinese military maneuvers around Taiwan.\n","(By Maa Yu and Joseph Yeh) \n","Enditem/cs\n","> Chinese Version\n","\n","Rally held in Taipei ahead of Tibet National Uprising Day=Taipei, March 5 (CNA) Taiwanese, Taiwan-based Tibetans, Uyghurs, and Hong Kongers took to the streets of Taipei on Saturday to call for world peace, Tibetan liberation, and for Taiwan to pay attention to Tibetan issues, ahead of the Tibetan Uprising Day.While the official day of the 63rd Tibetan Uprising Day, which commemorates the 1959 Tibetan rebellion against the Chinese Communist regime, is on Thursday, March 10, a rally was held Saturday to advocate for a stronger public response in Taiwan to decades of Chinese oppression in Tibet.Before the start of the rally, the demonstration was opened with the singing of the \"Gyallu,\" the anthem of the Tibetan Government-in-Exile, which is banned in China.Tibetan flags were also waved as three Tibetan monks chanted Tibetan Buddhism scriptures before a one-minute silence was held to pay tribute to the victims of the rebellion in 1959.After the rally began, attendees could be heard chanting \"Free Tibet,\" \"Tibet belongs to Tibetans\" and \"Tibet needs human rights.\"President of the Taiwan Tibetan Welfare Association Tenzin Namdak told the crowd that exiled Tibetans all over the world commemorate the rebellion on March 10 each year.He went on to condemn China for forcing the communist regime onto Tibet, while stating that \"Communism does not equal China,\" and that Taiwan should pay more attention to issues surrounding Tibet.Wu'er Kaixi (吾爾開希), a prominent student leader of Uyghur descent during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China, said in a speech that it was shameful to have to witness the oppression of Uyghurs, the invasion of Ukraine, and Taiwan being the only country in the world to publicly release Hong Kong documentary \"Revolution of Our Times,\" in the 21st century.However, he also added that many countries were beginning to reflect on the behavior of authoritarian states while strengthening democracy at home.Lam Wing-kee.

(TSMC) plunged below NT$15 trillion (US$53.19 billion) during Monday's morning session as the stock came under heavy pressure amid rising concerns about the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine.As of 11:50 a.m., the share price of TSMC, the most heavily weighted stock in the local market, had shed NT$19.00 or 3.19 percent to fall to NT$596.00 on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE), whose benchmark Taiex tumbled by 555.24 points or 3.13 percent to 17,181.28.The fall in TSMC shares pushed down the stock's market cap by NT$492.7 billion to NT$14.93 trillion as selling initially focused on large-cap tech stocks also happened across the board after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday that Washington and its allies were mulling the possibility of a ban on Russian oil and natural gas imports.After the stock's American depositary receipts (ADRs) fell by 3.43 percent on the U.S market, TSMC shares faced tremendous selling soon after the local equity market opened and downward pressure escalated with no signs of any immediate rebound, market analysts said.TSMC and other tech heavyweights moved sharply lower in the wake of a 1.66-percent fall on the tech-heavy Nasdaq index and a 2.42-percent decline on the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index on the U.S. markets Friday and the losses suffered by the Dow futures Sunday evening in the U.S., analysts said.Amid volatility on the U.S. markets, foreign institutional investors tend to dump liquid high-priced large-cap stocks, like TSMC, to trim their portfolios in the local market, so the selling has nothing to do with the chipmaker's sound fundamentals, according to analysts.TSMC's losses contributed about 150 points to the Taiex's fall in Monday's morning session.Despite the recent volatile fluctuations in TSMC's share price, a U.S. brokerage said in a research note that it remained upbeat about the chipmaker's outlook as its advanced N3E process, which is based on the 3-nanometer technology, was showing an improving yield rate, and the development was expected to help the Taiwanese company secure more outsourcing orders from Intel Corp. to roll out central processing units.According to TSMC, the trial production of its 3nm process will start later this year on schedule and mass production will kick off in the second half of next year. The 5nm process is currently the most advanced technology which TSMC has in mass production.Worries over the war between Ukraine and Russia are expected to move the global financial markets and in turn, fluctuations of TSMC and many other high-priced tech stocks will also be dictated by geopolitical tensions, said analysts.Among other semiconductor stocks which suffered a plunge, smartphone chip designer MediaTek Inc. declined by 4.98 percent to NT$974.00 as of 11:50 a.m., marking the first time the stock has traded below the NT$1,000 mark since Nov. 12, 2021, when its share price closed at NT$983.00.In addition, United Microelectronics Corp., a smaller contract chipmaker in Taiwan, had fallen by 3.18 percent to NT$51.70 and dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chip supplier Nanya Technology Corp. plunged by 6.25 percent to NT$76.50 as of 11:50 a.m.The bellwether electronics sector fell by 3.50 percent with the semiconductor sub-index down by 3.77 percent as of 11:50 a.m.\n","(By Chang Chien-chung and Frances Huang) \n","Enditem/HY\n","\n","U.S. dollar higher in Taipei trading=Taipei, March 7 (CNA) The U.S. dollar was traded at NT$28.245 at 10 a.m. Monday on the Taipei Foreign Exchange, up NT$0.130 from the previous close.\n","(By Y.F.

challenges in the years ahead, the Ministry of Science and Technology said Tuesday, one day after the publication of a major United Nations climate change report.The ministry said in a statement that its latest study indicated that human-induced global warming could disrupt both local ecosystems and the lives of Taiwanese.There could be more extreme weather, including stronger typhoons, more severe droughts and intensive rain, the ministry said in response to the publication Monday of a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a U.N. body that assesses climate change related science.\"The world faces unavoidable multiple climate hazards over the next two decades with global warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius,\" according to the IPCC.\"Even temporarily exceeding this warming level will result in additional severe impacts, some of which will be irreversible,\" the panel said, warning that risks for society will also increase, including to infrastructure and low-lying coastal settlements.In the case of Taiwan, the ministry said, a global increase of 2 degrees will cause sea levels across the country to rise by 0.5 meters, while 4 degree growth will lead to a 1.2 meter increase, exponentially increasing the chance of flooding, particularly in southwestern Taiwan.Global warming could also damage ecosystems and the agricultural sector in Taiwan, the ministry said.It also pointed out that if global temperatures increased by an average of 2 degrees, Taiwan will see its rice harvest reduced by 5-20 percent and the spread of yellow fever mosquitoes -- a dengue fever agent-- further north.Taiwan should work with the global community to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve its ability to adapt to climate change, according to the

the festival, CCAT's executive officer, Lin Fang-ju (林芳如), said that previous versions of the event celebrated the life and contributions of late Taiwanese publisher and pro-democracy activist Cheng Nan-jung (鄭南榕).Cheng founded Freedom Era Weekly and famously set himself on fire on April 7, 1989, to implore Taiwan to adopt complete political freedom and move away from the one-party semi-authoritarian system under the then ruling Kuomintang (KMT).However, this year's festival aims to \"return some color back to history,\" so Taiwanese can better face their violent and brave past head-on.Only by confronting and understanding Taiwan's violent history can Taiwanese people be reborn through transitional justice and thrive, Lin said.The festival will feature artistic performances and exhibitions focusing on 40 years of authoritarian rule in Taiwan and fill in those parts of history that have been redacted, she added.Lin added that she hopes all municipalities will reflect on how best to remove authoritarian imagery within their jurisdictions to further the process of transitional justice.This year's festival will also focus on explaining the meaning of transitional justice through such events as symposiums and the screening of films, she saidThe fourth Born2BeFree Festival opens ahead of 228 Memorial Day which is celebrated across Taiwan as a national holiday on Monday.The memorial day was established in 1997 and seeks to solemnly commemorate the 228 Incident which started on Feb. 28, 1947 and resulted in the deaths of thousands during a brutal military crackdown under the KMT rule.This year marks the 75th anniversary of the incident.The freedom-themed festival runs until April 24.\n","(By Chao Li-yen and James Lo) \n","Enditem/AW\n","> Chinese

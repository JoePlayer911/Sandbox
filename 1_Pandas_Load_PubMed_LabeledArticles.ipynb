The analysis of medical databank shows that RASIP1 is upregulated in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) specimens. In this article, we demonstrated that RASIP1 is highly expressed in DLBCL cell lines, compared with primary B cells. The gain- and loss-of-function experiments were performed to investigate the effects of RASIP1 on DLBCL cells. CCK-8, flow cytometry, western blot, and transwell assays demonstrated that silence of RASIP1 inhibited proliferation, cell cycle transition, and invasion and induced significant apoptosis in DLBCL cells, and ectopic expression of RASIP1 played opposite roles. Xenograft results revealed that RASIP1 facilitated the growth of DLBCL cells in vivo. These findings suggest that RASIP1 may be required for malignancy of DLBCL cells. In addition, we also found that the expression of RASIP1 was negatively regulated by forkhead box O3 (FOXO3), which has been reported to suppress the proliferation of DLBCL cells. Our results indicate that FOXO3 is bound to the promoter sequence of RASIP1 and inhibits its transcription. The suppressive effects of FOXO3 on proliferation and invasion of DLBCL cells were neutralized by RASIP1. In conclusion, we demonstrate that FOXO3 negatively regulated RASIP1 facilitates growth and invasion of DLBCL cells, provides novel diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for DLBCL in clinic.',\n"," \"Public health impact of recombinant zoster vaccine for prevention of herpes zoster in US adults immunocompromised due to cancer.Individuals who are immunocompromised (IC) due to therapy or underlying disease are at increased risk of herpes zoster (HZ). This study evaluates the public health impact of recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) relative to no HZ vaccination for the prevention of HZ among adults aged ≥18\\u2009years diagnosed with selected cancers in the United States (US). A static Markov model was used to simulate three cohorts of individuals who are IC with cancer (time horizon of 30\\u2009years; one-year cycle length): hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients, patients with breast cancer (BC; a solid tumor example), and patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL; a hematological malignancy example). Cohort sizes reflect the estimated annual incidence of each condition in the US population (19,671 HSCT recipients, 279,100 patients with BC, and 8,480 patients with HL). Vaccination with RZV resulted in 2,297; 38,068; and 848 fewer HZ cases for HSCT recipients, patients with BC, and patients with HL, respectively (each versus no vaccine). Vaccination with RZV also resulted in 422; 3,184; and 93 fewer postherpetic neuralgia cases for HSCT, BC, and HL, respectively. Analyses estimated the quality-adjusted life years gained to be 109, 506, and 17 for HSCT, BC, and HL, respectively. To prevent one HZ case, the number needed to vaccinate was 9, 8, and 10, for HSCT, BC, and HL, respectively. These results suggest RZV vaccination may be an effective option to significantly reduce HZ disease burden among patients diagnosed with selected cancers in the US.\",\n"," 'Nimesulide, a COX-2 inhibitor, sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by promoting DR5 clustering †.Nimesulide is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and a COX-2 inhibitor with antitumor and antiproliferative activities that induces apoptosis in oral, esophagus, breast, and pancreatic cancer cells. Despite being removed from the market due to hepatotoxicity, nimesulide is still an important research tool being used to develop new anticancer drugs. Multiple studies have been done to modify the nimesulide skeleton to develop more potent anticancer agents and related compounds are promising scaffolds for future development. As such, establishing a mechanism of action for nimesulide remains an important part of realizing its potential. Here, we show that nimesulide enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis in resistant pancreatic cancer cells by promoting clustering of DR5 in the plasma membrane. In this way, nimesulide acts like a related compound, DuP-697, which sensitizes TRAIL-resistant colon cancer cells in a similar manner. Our approach applies a time-resolved FRET-based biosensor that monitors DR5 clustering and conformational states in the plasma membrane. We show that this tool can be used for future high-throughput screens to identify novel, nontoxic small molecule scaffolds to overcome TRAIL resistance in cancer cells.',\n"," 'Chinese medicinal herbs for reducing endocrine therapy-induced side effects in patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.CONTEXT: Chinese medicinal herbs (CMH) have been considered a potentially efficacious approach for patients with breast cancer that experience adverse effects from endocrine treatment. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of CMH on endocrine therapy-induced side effects in patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer. METHODS: Ten databases (e.g., PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Information Database and other databases) were searched up to 20 May 2022. The search terms included Chinese herb, breast cancer, endocrine therapy, clinical trial and their mesh terms. The study selection and data extraction were performed by two independent reviewers. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias method. RESULTS: A total of 31 studies with 2288 patients were included. There were significant improvements in bone mineral density (BMD) [lumbar BMD (MD 0.08, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.09, p\\u2009<\\u20090.00001) and femoral neck BMD (MD 0.08, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.10, p\\u2009<\\u20090.00001)] and bone gal protein (BGP) (MD 0.24, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.31, p\\u2009<\\u20090.00001), with a significant reduction in triglycerides (MD -0.53, 95% CI -1.00 to -0.07, p\\u2009<\\u20090.05) and no effect on estradiol levels (MD 0.90, 95% CI -0.31 to 2.12, p\\u2009=\\u20090.15). CONCLUSIONS: CMH combined with complementary therapy can moderately reduce endocrine therapy-induced side effects, including bone loss and dyslipidemia in patients with HR\\u2009+\\u2009breast cancer, revealing the potential role of CMH in treating (HR+) breast cancer. More high-quality RCTs are warranted to further validate the effectiveness and safety of CMH.',\n"," 'Development of new TAK-285 derivatives as potent EGFR/HER2 inhibitors possessing antiproliferative effects against 22RV1 and PC3 prostate carcinoma cell lines.Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein tyrosine kinases co-expressed in various cancers such as ovarian, breast, colon, and prostate subtypes. Herein, new TAK-285 derivatives (9a-h) were synthesised, characterised, and biologically evaluated as dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitors. Compound 9f exhibited IC(50) values of 2.3\\u2009nM over EGFR and 234\\u2009nM over HER2, which is 38-fold of staurosporine and 10-fold of TAK-285 over EGFR. Compound 9f also showed high selectivity profile when tested over a small kinase panel. Compounds 9a-h showed IC(50) values in the range of 1.0-7.3\\u2009nM and 0.8-2.8\\u2009nM against PC3 and 22RV1 prostate carcinoma cell lines, respectively.

Among the tested compounds, 6i exhibited the most potent anti-proliferative activity towards NSCLC, CNS, Ovarian, Prostate, Colon, Melanoma, Breast, and Renal cancers with good to weak cytostatic activity and non-lethal actions. 6i demonstrated higher selectivity for cancer than normal cells. 6i could significantly increase the accumulation of S-phase cells during the cell cycle distribution of cancer cells with high potency in the induction of apoptosis. The results unveiled that 6i probably acts through dual inhibition of DHFR and TS enzymes (IC(50) = 2.41 and 8.88\\u2009µM, correspondingly). Docking studies of 6i displayed that N1-p-bromophenyl and C3-Methyl groups participate in substantial hydrophobic interactions. The drug-likeness features inferred that 6i met the acceptance criteria of Pfizer. Taking together, 6i could be a promising prototype for further optimization as an effective anticancer drug.',\n"," 'The association between breast cancer and consumption of dairy products: a systematic review.BACKGROUND: Among the world, the most frequently discovered and fatal cancer in women is breast cancer (BC). From the perspective of public health, estimating the BC risk linked to dairy intake may aid in comprehensive management. In epidemiological research data on the association between eating dairy foods and the risk of BC are conflicting. Therefore, we sought to assess the link between dairy food consumption and the development of BC. MAIN TEXT: To summarize and quantify the most recent findings on consuming milk or other dairy foods and the development of BC, we performed a systematic literature review. We checked through several databases for relevant publications published in English up to January 2022. Of the 82 articles identified, only 18 met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Nine Prospective, seven Retrospective and two Cross-Sectional studies were finally identified. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, dairy consumption was inversely associated with the risk of developing breast cancer. Future studies will help elucidate the role of dairy products in human health, and their use within a balanced diet should be considered.KEY MESSAGESThe effect of different types of dairy products, and possible dose-response relationships on BC risk remains unknown.Estimating BC risk associated with dairy consumption may help to take the decision-making of physicians and public health policy in developing preventive strategies to reduce its occurrence.This systematic review was conducted to assess dairy consumption and BC risk.Overall, inverse associations were found when looking at dairy consumption and BC risk.',\n"," 'Triple targeting of mutant EGFR(L858R/T790M), COX-2, and 15-LOX: design and synthesis of novel quinazolinone tethered phenyl urea derivatives for anti-inflammatory and anticancer evaluation.We designed and synthesised novel quinazolinone tethered phenyl urea derivatives (6a-p) that triple target the double mutant EGFR(L858R/T790M), COX-2, and 15-LOX. Compounds (6e, 6d, 6j, 6m, and 6n) not only had low micromolar IC50 inhibitory activities against the three targets, but they also showed good selectivity for COX-2 over COX-1 and for EGFR(L858R/T790M) over wild-type EGFR. Except for 6e and 6n, all of the tested compounds inhibited the NO production significantly more potently than celecoxib, diclofenac, and indomethacin. Compounds 6i and 6k reduced ROS levels more effectively than celecoxib and diclofenac. In terms of inhibiting TNF-α production, 6o-treated cells showed TNF-α level, which is ∼10 times lower than celecoxib. Furthermore, 6e and 6j had the highest anticancer activity against the breast cancer cell line BT-459 with growth inhibition percentages of 67.14 and 70.07%, respectively. Docking studies confirm their favoured binding affinity. The proposed compounds could be promising multi-targeted leads.',\n"," \"Pregnancy and neonatal outcomes following malignancy in pregnancy at a tertiary care Canadian center: a retrospective chart review.Objective: Data on pregnancy-associated cancers (PACs) are lacking. The objectives of this study were to determine the incidence of PACs and describe the characteristics and outcomes of pregnancies affected by malignancy at a single tertiary care center in Ottawa, Canada.Methods: This was a retrospective chart review of individuals with PAC at The Ottawa Hospital (TOH) between 2011-2022. Eligible cases were identified from the TOH Data Warehouse, the TOH instance of the Better Outcomes Registry & Network Ontario, and the TOH Division of Maternal Fetal Medicine's Perinates database. Chart reviews were conducted to confirm case eligibility and to extract demographic, oncologic, obstetrical, and neonatal measures. The annual incidence of PAC over the 11-year period was reported per 1000 deliveries. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the sample, including frequency (n) and proportions (%) for categorical variables and mean and standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables.Results: The final cohort included 59 individuals with PAC at TOH between 2011-2022. The annual incidence of PAC ranged from 0.47 to 1.54 per 1000 deliveries. The most common PACs were breast cancer (28.8%), Hodgkin lymphoma (10.2%), and thyroid cancer (8.5%). Common interventions during pregnancy included chemotherapy (33.9%) and surgical intervention (32.2%). A total of 19 individuals (32.2%) did not undergo PAC-related treatment during pregnancy. There were 55 livebirths (91.7%), 2 spontaneous abortions (3.3%), 3 induced abortions (5.0%), and no stillbirths. Among livebirths, the mean gestational age was 37.4\\u2009±\\u20092.8\\u2009weeks and the mean birthweight was 2920.3\\u2009±\\u2009650.0\\u2009g. All neonates had reassuring 5-minute Apgar scores, 18 (32.7%) were admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit/Special Care Nursery (NICU/SCN), and 8 (14.5%) were noted to have a mild congenital abnormality.Conclusion: This study shows promising perinatal outcomes for patients with PAC and their neonates. Ongoing surveillance of PAC is needed to better inform care for this patient population.\",\n"," 'Application of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in men over 75 years: an analysis of comparative outcomes.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to summarize the current evidence regarding the feasibility of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) in men aged over 75\\u2009years. METHOD: A comprehensive search of four electronic databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure, PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library) was performed to identify eligible comparative studies as of April 2022. Parameters, including perioperative results and oncological and functional outcomes, were evaluated. RESULTS: Seven articles with 7575 patients undergoing RARP were included in this study. Patients with prostate cancer were grouped by age ≥ 75\\u2009years versus < 75\\u2009years. Our results demonstrated that compared with the older group, the younger group had better potency (p\\u2009<\\u2009.00001). However, there were no significant differences in operation time (p\\u2009=\\u2009.29), estimated blood loss (p\\u2009=\\u2009.13), length of hospital stay (p\\u2009=\\u2009.48), complications (p\\u2009=\\u2009.22), continence (p\\u2009=\\u2009.21), positive surgical margin (p\\u2009=\\u2009.28), and biochemical recurrence (p\\u2009=\\u2009.74) between the groups. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that the perioperative, oncological, and functional outcomes in men aged over 75\\u2009years undergoing RARP were not significantly different from those of their younger counterparts. RARP is feasible in men aged over 75\\u2009years.',\n"," 'Enhanced therapeutic efficacy of doxorubicin against multidrug-resistant breast cancer with reduced cardiotoxicity.Doxorubicin (DOX), a commonly used anti-cancer drug, is limited by its cardiotoxicity and multidrug resistance (MDR) of tumor cells. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a natural antioxidant component, can effectively reduce the cardiotoxicity of DOX. Meanwhile, EGCG can inhibit the expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and reverse the MDR of tumor cells. In this study, DOX is connected with low molecular weight polyethyleneimine (PEI) via hydrazone bond to get the pH-sensitive PEI-DOX, which is then combined with EGCG to prevent the cardiotoxicity of DOX and reverse the MDR of cancer cells. In addition, folic acid (FA) modified polyethylene glycol (PEG) (PEG-FA) is added to get the targeted system PEI-DOX/EGCG/FA. The MDR reversal and targeting ability of PEI-DOX/EGCG/FA is performed by cytotoxicity and in vivo anti-tumor activity on multidrug resistant MCF-7 cells (MCF-7/ADR). Additionally, we investigate the anti-drug resistant mechanism by Western Blot. The ability of EGCG to reduce DOX cardiotoxicity is confirmed by cardiotoxicity assay. In conclusion, PEI-DOX/EGCG/FA can inhibit the expression of P-gp and reverse the MDR in tumor cells. It also shows the ability of remove oxygen free radicals effectively to prevent the cardiotoxicity of DOX.',\n"," \"PEG-conjugated bovine haemoglobin enhances efficiency of chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin with alleviating DOX-induced splenocardiac toxicity in the breast cancer.Doxorubicin (DOX) is an effective chemotherapeutic agent widely used for cancer treatment. However, hypoxia in tumour tissue and obvious adverse effects particularly cardiotoxicity restricts the clinical usage of DOX. Our study is based on the co-administration of haemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) and DOX in a breast cancer model to investigate HBOCs' ability to enhance chemotherapeutic effectiveness and its capabilities to alleviate the side effects induced by DOX. In an in-vitro study, the results suggested the cytotoxicity of DOX was significantly improved when combined with HBOCs in a hypoxic environment, and produced more γ-H2AX indicating higher DNA damage than free DOX did. Compared with administration of free DOX, combined therapy exhibited a stronger tumour suppressive effect in an in-vivo study. Further mechanism studies showed that the expression of various proteins such as hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), CD31, CD34, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in tumour tissues was also significantly reduced in the combined treatment group. In addition, HBOCs can significantly reduce the splenocardiac toxicity induced by DOX, according to the results of the haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and histological investigation. This study suggested that PEG-conjugated bovine haemoglobin may not only reduce the hypoxia in tumours and increase the efficiency of chemotherapeutic agent DOX, but also alleviate the irreversible heart toxicity caused by DOX-inducted splenocardiac dysregulation.\",\n"," 'The dual-crosslinked prospective values of RAI14 for the diagnosis and chemosurveillance in triple negative breast cancer.OBJECTIVE: The exploration of non-invasive biomarkers for assessing tumor response is critical to optimize treatment decisions. In this study, we aimed at determining the potential role of RAI14 in the early diagnosis and evaluation of chemotherapy efficacy in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). METHODS: We recruited 116 patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer, 30 patients with benign breast disease and 30 healthy controls. In addition, 57 TNBC patients were collected in serum at different time points (C0, C2 and C4) for chemotherapy monitoring. The expression of serum RAI14 and CA15-3 were quantified by Elisa and electrochemiluminescence assay, respectively. Then we compared the performances of markers with the chemotherapy efficacy assessed by imaging. RESULTS: RAI14 is significantly overexpressed in TNBC and is linked to adverse clinicopathological features such as tumor burden, CA15-3 levels and the ER, PR, and HER2 status of the patients. ROC curve analysis showed that RAI14 improves the diagnostic performance for CA15-3(AUC(RAI14) = 0.934 vs. AUC(CA15-3) = 0.836), especially embodied in early-stage breast cancer diagnosis and patients with CA15-3 negativity. Furthermore, RAI14 behaves well in reproducing treatment response which was consistent with clinical Imaging assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Recent studies showed that RAI14 has a complementary effect to CA15-3 and a test combining the two parameters can improve the detection rate of early triple-negative breast cancer. At the same time, RAI14 plays a more important role in chemotherapy monitoring than CA15-3 as the change in its concentration is in line with the tumor volume variation. Taken together, RAI14 is a reliable novel marker in the early diagnosis and chemotherapy monitoring of triple-negative breast cancer.',\n"," 'Bioinformatic analysis of the clinicopathological and prognostic significance of oocyte-arresting BTG4 mRNA expression in gynecological cancers.BTG4 arrests the cell cycle and suppresses oocyte and embryonic development. We performed a bioinformatic analysis of BTG4 expression. BTG4 expression was downregulated in breast cancer compared with normal tissues (p\\u2009<\\u2009.05), but the opposite was observed in cervical, endometrial and ovarian cancers (p\\u2009<\\u2009.05). BTG4 methylation was negatively correlated with its mRNA expression in breast, cervical and endometrial cancers (p\\u2009<\\u2009.05). BTG4 mRNA expression was negatively correlated with T staging and distant metastasis of breast cancer; and with tumor invasion, clinical stage, low weight and BMI, low histological grade and no diabetes in endometrial cancer but positively with T stage and non-keratinizing squamous carcinoma in endometrial cancer. BTG4 expression was negatively correlated with the survival of ovarian cancer patients (p\\u2009<\\u2009.05), but positively for breast, cervical and endometrial cancers (p\\u2009<\\u2009.05). BTG4 expression is thus a potential marker reflecting the carcinogenesis, aggressiveness and prognosis in gynecological cancers.Impact StatementWhat is already known on this subject? Previous studies have revealed the structure and location of BTG4. BTG4 inhibit cell proliferative, promote apoptosis, induce G1 cell cycle arrest. BTG4 promotes the development of mouse embryos from cell stage 1 to 2. The methylation and biological function of BTG4 were clarified in gastric and/or colorectal cancer cells.What do the results of this study add? BTG4 is found to closely link to reflect the carcinogenesis, histogenesis, aggressive behaviors and prognosis of gynecological cancers, and involved in ligand-receptor interaction, microtubule motor activity, dynein light chain binding, cilium organization, assembly, and movement in endometrial and ovarian cancers.What are the implications of these finding for clinical practice and/or further research? Aberrant BTG4 mRNA expression can be employed as a marker of the tumorigenesis, histogenesis, aggressiveness and prognosis of gynecological cancers in the future practice and guide the investigation of BTG4-related signal pathways.',\n"," 'Polysialic acid-functionalized liposomes for efficient honokiol delivery to inhibit breast cancer growth and metastasis.To improve the anti-metastasis effects of honokiol (HNK) on breast cancer, we designed cationic liposomes (Lip) in which HNK was encapsulated into Lip, and its surface was modified with negatively charged polysialic acid (PSA-Lip-HNK) for efficient treatment of breast cancer. PSA-Lip-HNK possessed a homogeneous spherical shape and high encapsulation efficiency. In vitro 4T1 cell experiments indicated that PSA-Lip-HNK increased cellular uptake and cytotoxicity via the endocytosis pathway mediated by PSA and selectin receptors. Furthermore, the significant antitumor metastasis impact of PSA-Lip-HNK was confirmed by wound healing and cell migration and invasion. Enhanced in vivo tumor accumulation of the PSA-Lip-HNK was observed in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice by living fluorescence imaging. For in vivo antitumor experiments using 4T1 tumor-bearing mice, PSA-Lip-HNK exhibited a higher tumor growth and metastasis inhibition compared with unmodified liposomes. Therefore, we believe that PSA-Lip-HNK well combined biocompatible PSA nano-delivery and chemotherapy, providing a promising drug delivery approach for metastatic breast cancer therapy.',\n"," 'Assessment of knowledge, understanding and awareness of Chinese women clinical staff towards menopause hormone therapy: a survey study.Menopausal Hormone Therapy (MHT) is recommended for climacteric peri postmenopausal symptoms. The rate of use of MHT in China is much lower than the western regions. Therefore, a survey was conducted for the understanding and utilization of MHT among clinical staff in various hospitals of China. A total of 3216 eligible questionnaires were included for the evaluation. According to 19.2% participant opinion, MHT could relieve menopausal symptoms, whereas the majority had no knowledge of the benefits and risks of MHT. The most common concern about MHT was the risk of cancer and about 430 (13.4%) and 176 (5.5%) participants were apprehensive that MHT could increase the risk of breast and endometrial cancer, respectively. This survey demonstrated that the knowledge of clinical staff was not comprehensive and they should be educated more about the use of MHT so that this knowledge can be imbibed into the general population.Impact StatementWhat is already known on this subject?

The survey demonstrated that Chinese medical professionals had some understanding about MHT, but their knowledge was not comprehensive. Thus, it is necessary to educate these medical professionals which in turn will help them to imbibe this knowledge among the general population.',\n"," 'Screening for breast and cervical cancer among OST patients: a qualitative study of barriers and suggested interventions to increase participation.PURPOSE: Women with current or previous drug use are at risk of poor breast and cervical cancer outcomes. While screening is known to decrease cancer mortality, screening participation is sparsely investigated among drug dependent women. The aim of this study was to explore experiences of breast and cervical cancer screening-including barriers and suggested interventions to promote increased participation-among women in opioid substitution treatment (OST). METHODS: Three focus group interviews were conducted at one OST clinic in Malmö, Sweden. The interviews were moderated by OST staff, assisted by a researcher. A descriptive qualitative analysis was carried out using a template analysis approach, employing a model of healthcare access to organize the description of barriers. RESULTS: The 11 participants reported several barriers to screening access, affecting the perceived need of screening and the opportunities to seek and reach screening services. Some barriers appear to be specific to women with previous or current drug use. Suggested interventions were moral and practical support, integrated/specialized delivery of screening services, and enhanced screening invitation procedures. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings provide insight to difficulties with screening compliance among women with current or previous drug use, and provide a knowledge base for quantitative and intervention studies.',\n"," 'SREKA-targeted liposomes for highly metastatic breast cancer therapy.Chemotherapy is still a leading therapeutic approach in various tumor types that is often accompanied by a poor prognosis because of metastases. PEGylated liposomes with CREKA targeting moiety are well-known therapeutic agents, especially in highly metastatic experimental models. CREKA specifically targets tumor-associated ECM, which is present at the primary, as well as metastatic tumor sites. To better understand the function of the targeting moieties, we decided to design various liposome formulations with different amounts of targeting moiety attached to their DSPE-PEG molecules. Moreover, a new tumor-homing pentapeptide (SREKA) was designed, and a novel conjugation strategy between SREKA and DSPE-PEGs. First, the in vitro proliferation inhibition of drug-loaded liposomes and the cellular uptake of their cargo were investigated. Afterward, liposome stability in murine blood and drug accumulation in different tissues were measured. Furthermore, in vivo tumor growth, and metastasis inhibition potencies of the different liposome formulations were examined. According to our comparative studies, SREKA-liposomes have a uniform phenotype after formulation and have similar characteristics and tumor-homing capabilities to CREKA-liposomes. However, the exchange of the N-terminal cysteine to serine during conjugation results in a higher production yield and better stability upon conjugation to DSPE-PEGs. We also showed that SREKA-liposomes have significant inhibition on primary tumor growth and metastasis incidence; furthermore, increase the survival rate of tumor-bearing mice. Besides, we provide evidence that the amount of targeting moiety attached to DSPE-PEGs is largely responsible for the stability of liposomes, therefore it plays an important role in toxicity and targeting.',\n"," 'New benzothiazole hybrids as potential VEGFR-2 inhibitors: design, synthesis, anticancer evaluation, and in silico study.A new series of 2-aminobenzothiazole hybrids linked to thiazolidine-2,4-dione 4a-e, 1,3,4-thiadiazole aryl urea 6a-d, and cyanothiouracil moieties 8a-d was synthesised. The in\\xa0vitro antitumor effect of the new hybrids was assessed against three cancer cell lines, namely, HCT-116, HEPG-2, and MCF-7 using Sorafenib (SOR) as a standard drug. Among the tested compounds, 4a was the most potent showing IC50 of 5.61, 7.92, and 3.84\\u2009µM, respectively. Furthermore, compounds 4e and 8a proved to have strong impact on breast cancer cell line with IC50 of 6.11 and 10.86\\u2009µM, respectively. The three compounds showed a good safety profile towards normal WI-38 cells. Flow cytometric analysis of the three compounds in MCF-7 cells revealed that compounds 4a and 4c inhibited cell population in the S phase, whereas 8a inhibited the population in the G1/S phase. The most promising compounds were subjected to a VEGFR-2 inhibitory assay where 4a emerged as the best active inhibitor of VEGFR-2 with IC50 91\\u2009nM, compared to 53\\u2009nM for SOR. In silico analysis showed that the three new hybrids succeeded to link to the active site like the co-crystallized inhibitor SOR.',\n"," 'Potential lipid-based strategies of amphotericin B designed for oral administration in clinical application.Amphotericin B (AmB) is regarded as a first-line therapy against life-threatening invasive fungal infections. Due to its poor oral bioavailability, AmB is restricted to intravenous administration in clinical practice. As science continues to move forward, two lipid-based formulations are successfully developed for oral AmB administration, currently undergoing phase I clinical trials. Encouragingly, lipid-AmB conjugates with emulsions also exhibit a better bioavailability, which may be another strategy to design oral AmB formulation in clinical practice. Thus, this review mainly focused on the two lipid-based formulations in clinical trials, and discussed the potential perspectives of AmB-lipid conjugation-loaded nanocochleates and emulsions.',\n"," 'Vasomotor symptoms and management of women undergoing treatment for\\xa0breast cancer: literature review with focus on the therapeutic potential of\\xa0cytoplasmic pollen extract.OBJECTIVE: Effective management of vasomotor symptoms (VMS) in patients undergoing treatment for breast cancer (BC) represents a critical but frequent unmet need. This review summarizes the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical features of VMS in patients with BC and provides a synopsis of the complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) approaches in relieving VMS with a focus on purified cytoplasm of pollen (PCP). METHODS: The literature on VMS epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical burden, and CAM treatment in healthy women and patients with BC was reviewed. RESULTS: VMS are common in patients with BC undergoing hormonal treatment and negatively impact quality of life, leading to treatment discontinuation in up to 25% of patients with detrimental impact on risk of BC recurrence and overall survival. CAM approaches to treat VMS in patients with BC include vitamin E, phytoestrogens, and black cohosh, even if there is a lack of solid evidence to guide clinicians in the choice of treatment. PCP, obtained according to standards of good manufacturing practice, has a definite pharmacological mechanism of action, is devoid of estrogen activity, and has shown clinical efficacy on menopause-associated symptoms with a favorable safety profile and high compliance. As such, it appears to represent a valid management option to improve quality of life in patients with pre- and postmenopausal BC. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians should actively investigate the presence and impact of VMS in patients receiving therapy for BC. Additional and appropriately sized randomized clinical trials are needed to provide clear evidence on how to best meet the needs of patients with BC suffering from menopause-associated symptoms.',\n"," \"Factors associated with poor sleep quality in midlife Singaporean women: The Integrated Women's Health program (IWHP).OBJECTIVE: To examine factors associated with poor sleep quality in community-dwelling midlife women. METHODS: Healthy women (aged 45-69 years) of Chinese, Malay and Indian ethnicities attending well-women clinics at the National University Hospital, Singapore, completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). A PQSI score >5 denoted poor sleep quality. The women filled out validated questionnaires covering menopausal and genito-urinary symptoms, and mental health. Physical performance was measured. Bone mineral density and visceral adiposity were assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Binary logistic regression analyses assessed independent factors for poor sleep. RESULTS: Poor sleep quality was reported in 38.2% of women (n\\xa0=\\xa01094, mean age: 56.4\\xa0±\\xa06.2 years). Indian women had higher sleep disturbance scores than Chinese women (mean\\xa0±\\xa0SD: 1.33\\xa0±\\xa00.58 vs 1.17\\xa0±\\xa00.49). Malays experienced more daytime dysfunction (0.54\\xa0±\\xa00.60 vs 0.33\\xa0±\\xa00.55) and had a higher overall PSQI score (6.00\\xa0±\\xa03.31 vs 5.02\\xa0±\\xa02.97) than the Chinese. A low education level (aOR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.01-3.05), feelings of irritability (2.67, 1.56-4.60) and vaginal dryness (1.62, 1.03-2.54) were associated with poor sleep quality in the adjusted multivariable model. Women with moderate to severe disability were ∼3 times (2.99, 1.20-7.44) more likely to experience less than ideal sleep quality, while urinary incontinence (1.53, 1.08-2.17) and breast cancer history (2.77, 1.36-5.64) were also associates of poor sleep quality. CONCLUSION: Self-reports of education level, irritability, vaginal dryness, disability, urinary incontinence, and breast cancer history were independently related to poor sleep. Ethnic differences suggest the need for targeted interventions among the ethnic groups.\",\n"," 'Utilization of a nanostructured lipid carrier encapsulating pitavastatin-Pinus densiflora oil for enhancing cytotoxicity against the gingival carcinoma HGF-1 cell line.Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common epithelial tumor of the oral cavity. Gingival tumors, a unique type of OSCC, account for 10% of these malignant tumors. The antineoplastic properties of statins, including pitavastatin (PV), and the essential oil of the Pinus densiflora leaf (Pd oil) have been adequately reported. The goal of this investigation was to develop nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) containing PV combined with Pd oil and to determine their cytotoxicity against the cell line of human gingival fibroblasts (HGF-1). A central composite quadratic design was adopted to optimize the nanocarriers. The particle size and stability index of the nano-formulations were measured to evaluate various characteristics. TEM analysis, the entrapment efficiency, dissolution efficiency, and the cytotoxic efficiency of the optimized PV-loaded nanostructured lipid carrier drug delivery system (PV-Pd-NLCs) were evaluated. Then, the optimal PV-Pd-NLCs was incorporated into a Carbopol 940® gel base and tested for its rheological features and its properties of release and cell viability. The optimized NLCs had a particle size of 98\\u2009nm and a stability index of 89%. The gel containing optimum PV-Pd-NLCs had reasonable dissolution efficiency and acceptable rheological behavior and acquired the best cytotoxic activity against HGF-1 cell line among all the formulations developed for the study. The in vitro cell viability studies revealed a synergistic effect between PV and Pd oil in the treatment of gingival cancer. These findings illustrated that the gel containing PV-Pd-NLCs could be beneficial in the local treatment of gingival cancer.',\n"," 'Effects of MFG-E8 expression on the biological characteristics of ovarian cancer cells via the AKT/mTOR/S6K signalling pathway.In this study, we assessed the effects of MFG-E8 on the biological characteristics of ovarian cancer cells and explored the underlying mechanisms. Human ovarian cancer SKOV3 cells were transfected with MFG-E8 siRNA or NC siRNA. CCK-8, cell adhesion, scratch-wound, and Transwell assays were used to detect changes in cell metastatic processes. Effects of MFG-E8 silencing on the proteins involved in AKT/mTOR/S6K signalling pathway were assessed using qRT-PCR and Western blotting. Transient silencing of MFG-E8 in SKOV3 cells decreased cell proliferation and downregulated the expression of CDK4, cyclin D1, and caspase-3 proteins. Cell adhesion, migration, and invasion were also suppressed. p-AKT, p-mTORC1, and p-p70S6K levels decreased following MFG-E8 knockdown. Hence, MFG-E8 enhances carcinogenesis and affects the AKT/mTOR/S6K signalling pathway in ovarian cancer cells. In conclusion, our results suggested that MFG-E8 could promote ovarian cancer via AKT/mTOR/S6K signalling pathway which improved our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in ovarian cancer.IMPACT STATEMENTWhat is already known on this subject? Milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor 8 (MFG-E8) is expressed in several types of cancers such as oesophageal, breast, and liver. However, the mechanism of MFG-E8 involving in EOC remains unknown. We previously found that MFG-E8 expression was related to pathological staging, tissue differentiation, platinum sensitivity, ascites state, and other clinicopathological characteristics.What the results of this study add? Due to a series of in vitro studies, we confirmed that MFG-E8 is involved in the process of proliferation, invasion and metastasis. Our results show that silencing MFG-E8 can significantly inhibit the expression of cyclin D1 and CDK4 in EOC SKOV3 cells. MFG-E8 enhances carcinogenesis and affects the AKT/mTOR/S6K signaling pathway in ovarian cancer.What the implications are of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Taken together, our findings suggest that MFG-E8 may be an oncogene in EOC and provide new insights into the mechanism of MFG-E8 in the progression of EOC.',\n"," 'A key regulatory loop AK4P1/miR-375/SP1 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is one of the leading lethal human cancer types and is notorious for its poor prognosis. A series of bioinformatic analyses and experimental validations were employed to explore the role and mechanism of pseudogene-derived RNAs in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Consequently, a total of 13 upregulated and 7 downregulated pseudogene-derived RNAs in pancreatic adenocarcinoma were identified. Survival analysis revealed a statistically predictive role of AK4P1 for unfavourable prognosis of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Subcellular location analysis indicated that AK4P1 was mainly located in cytoplasm, in which AK4P1 might competitively bind to tumour suppressive miR-375 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Further analysis showed that SP1 was a potential downstream target gene of miR-375 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Intriguingly, expression determination validated that SP1 could positively regulate AK4P1 levels in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Finally, AK4P1 might also exert its effects by interacting with oncogenic parental gene AK4 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Conclusively, the present study elucidated a key regulatory loop AK4P1/miR-375/SP1 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.',\n"," 'Ferric-loaded lipid nanoparticles inducing ferroptosis-like cell death for\\xa0antibacterial wound healing.Skin infection is a major health issue that usually is caused by the continuous proliferation of bacteria in wounds. With the abuse of antibiotics worldwide, the battle against skin infection is becoming more and more difficult. Therefore, the development of new ways with different antibacterial mechanisms to current antibiotics is urgently needed. Inspired by the powerful inhibition of ferroptosis used in cancer therapy, here in our study, ferric-loaded lipid nanoparticles (Fe-LNPs) with unform size (∼130\\u2009nm) and surface charge (∼12\\u2009mV) were constructed and found to effectively inhibit the growth of both Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, S. aureus) and negative (Escherichia coli, E. coli) strains, possibly due to induction of ferroptosis-like cell death mechanisms. Most importantly, Fe-LNPs can also effectively inhibit the proliferation of S. aureus in a skin infection model and promote the healing of wounds. The Fe-LNPs can be applied as a powerful antibacterial formulation for future application in clinic.',\n"," 'Design, synthesis and antitumor evaluation of novel pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidines incorporating different amino acid conjugates as potential DHFR inhibitors.The present study aimed to investigate the antitumor effect of simultaneous inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) enzyme. We designed some novel pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidines bearing different amino acid conjugates as efficient antifolate agents attributable to their structural similarity with methotrexate (MTX) and MTX-related antifolates. All compounds were tested to screen their enzymatic inhibition against DHFR compared with the reference drug MTX and for their in\\xa0vitro antitumor cytotoxicity against six MTX-resistant cancer cell lines. The flow cytometry indicated that the most potent compound 7f arrested MCF-7 cells in the S-phase and induced apoptosis. Western blot for visualisation proved the ability of compound 7f to induce the expression of proapoptotic caspases and Bax proteins in MCF-7 breast cancer cell line beside its ability to diminish the expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein. Molecular modelling studies concluded that compound 7f displayed better binding energy than that of the normal ligand MTX. HIGHLIGHTSNew pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine derivatives 7a-m which are structurally similar to the classical methotrexate (MTX) and MTX-related antifolates were synthesised as antitumor agents.Novel N-acyl amino acid compound 7f exhibited marked DHFR inhibition activity that are parralel to both the molecular docking results and cytotoxic activity.Compound 7f could induce the expression of proapoptotic caspases and Bax proteins in MCF-7 breast cancer cell line beside its ability to diminish the expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein.All prepared compounds obey Lipinski rule of five except compound 7f.',\n"," 'Biological evaluation, docking studies, and in silico ADME prediction of some pyrimidine and pyridine derivatives as potential EGFR(WT) and EGFR(T790M) inhibitors.Herein, a set of pyridine and pyrimidine derivatives were assessed for their impact on the cell cycle and apoptosis. Human breast cancer (MCF7), hepatocellular carcinoma (HEPG2), larynx cancer (HEP2), lung cancer (H460), colon cancers (HCT116 and Caco2), and hypopharyngeal cancer (FADU), and normal Vero cell lines were used. Compounds 8 and 14 displayed outstanding effects on the investigated cell lines and were further tested for their antioxidant activity in MCF7, H460, FADU, HEP2, HEPG2, HCT116, Caco2, and Vero cells by measuring superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde content (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), and nitric oxide (NO) content. Besides, Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection and cell cycle DNA index using the HEPG-2 cell line were established on both compounds as well.

There is an imminent need to establish validation platforms that enable fair and transparent testing of these systems against external data. APPROACH: We developed validation of artificial intelligence for breast imaging (VAI-B), a platform for independent validation of AI algorithms in breast imaging. The platform is a hybrid solution, with one part implemented in the cloud and another in an on-premises environment at Karolinska Institute. Cloud services provide the flexibility of scaling the computing power during inference time, while secure on-premises clinical data storage preserves their privacy. A MongoDB database and a python package were developed to store and manage the data on-premises. VAI-B requires four data components: radiological images, AI inferences, radiologist assessments, and cancer outcomes. RESULTS: To pilot test VAI-B, we defined a case-control population based on 8080 patients diagnosed with breast cancer and 36,339 healthy women based on the Swedish national quality registry for breast cancer. Images and radiological assessments from more than 100,000 mammography examinations were extracted from hospitals in three regions of Sweden. The images were processed by AI systems from three vendors in a virtual private cloud to produce abnormality scores related to signs of cancer in the images. A total of 105,706 examinations have been processed and stored in the database. CONCLUSIONS: We have created a platform that will allow downstream evaluation of AI systems for breast cancer detection, which enables faster development cycles for participating vendors and safer AI adoption for participating hospitals. The platform was designed to be scalable and ready to be expanded should a new vendor want to evaluate their system or should a new hospital wish to obtain an evaluation of different AI systems on their images.',\n"," 'Malmö Breast ImaginG database: objectives and development.PURPOSE: We describe the design and implementation of the Malmö Breast ImaginG (M-BIG) database, which will support research projects investigating various aspects of current and future breast cancer screening programs. Specifically, M-BIG will provide clinical data to:1.investigate the effect of breast cancer screening on breast cancer prognosis and mortality;2.develop and validate the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in breast image interpretation; and3.develop and validate image-based radiological breast cancer risk profiles. APPROACH: The M-BIG database is intended to include a wide range of digital mammography (DM) and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) examinations performed on women at the Mammography Clinic in Malmö, Sweden, from the introduction of DM in 2004 through 2020. Subjects may be included multiple times and for diverse reasons. The image data are linked to extensive clinical, diagnostic, and demographic data from several registries. RESULTS: To date, the database contains a total of 451,054 examinations from 104,791 women. During the inclusion period, 95,258 unique women were screened. A total of 19,968 examinations were performed using DBT, whereas the rest used DM. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the design and implementation of the M-BIG database as a representative and accessible medical image database linked to various types of medical data. Work is ongoing to add features and curate the existing data.',\n"," 'Pharmacokinetic profiling of quinazoline-4(3H)-one analogs as EGFR inhibitors: 3D-QSAR modeling, molecular docking studies and the design of therapeutic agents.OBJECTIVES: Breast tumor is ranked as the most common tumor type identified among women globally with over 1.7 million cases annually, representing 11.9% of the total number of cancer cases. Approved anti-breast tumor drugs exhibit several side effects and some patients develop resistance during the early treatment stage. This study aimed to use an in-silico approach to identify and design potential therapeutic agents. METHODS: Robust 3D-QSAR models were developed using quinazoline-4(3H)-one analogs as EGFR inhibitors. The best model was then selected based on statistical parameters and was subsequently used to design more potent therapeutic agents. Molecular docking simulation was executed using the data set and the designed compounds to identify lead compounds which were further screened by pharmacokinetic profiling by applying SwissADME and pkCSM software. RESULTS: Internal validations of the best CoMFA and CoMSIA models (R(2)\\xa0=\\xa00.855 and 0.895; Q(2)\\xa0=\\xa00.570 and 0.599) passed the threshold values for the establishment of a consistent QSAR model. The constructed models were further validated externally using six compounds as a test set, thus revealing a satisfactory predicted correlation coefficient (R(2) (pred)\\xa0=\\xa00.657 and 0.681). The CoMSIA_SHE models with the best statistical parameters were further subjected to applicability domain checks and only three influentials were detected. These were then utilized to design five novel compounds with activities ranging from 5.62 to 6.03. Molecular docking studies confirmed that compounds 20 to 26, with docking scores ranging from\\xa0-163.729 to\\xa0-169.796, represented lead compounds with higher docking scores compared to Gefitinib (-127.495). Furthermore, the designed compounds exhibited better docking scores ranging from\\xa0-171.379 to\\xa0-179.138. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacological studies identified compounds 20, 24 26 and the designed compounds 2, 3, 5 as feasible drug candidates. However, these theoretical findings should now be validated experimentally.',\n"," 'The dynamics along the biointerface between the epithelial and cancer mesenchymal cells: Modeling consideration.Epithelial cancer is the one of most lethal cancer type worldwide. Targeting the early stage of disease would allow dramatic improvements in the survival of cancer patients. The early stage of the disease is related to cancer cell spreading across surrounding healthy epithelium. Consequently, deeper insight into cell dynamics along the biointerface between epithelial and cancer (mesenchymal) cells is necessary in order to control the disease as soon as possible. Cell dynamics along this epithelial-cancer biointerface is the result of the interplay between various biological and physical mechanisms. Despite extensive research devoted to study cancer cell spreading across the epithelium, we still do not understand the physical mechanisms which influences the dynamics along the biointerface. These physical mechanisms are related to the interplay between physical parameters such as: (1) interfacial tension between cancer and epithelial subpopulations, (2) established interfacial tension gradients, (3) the bending rigidity of the biointerface and its impact on the interfacial tension, (4) surface tension of the subpopulations, (5) viscoelasticity caused by collective cell migration, and (6) cell residual stress accumulation. The main goal of this study is to review some of these physical parameters in the context of the epithelial/cancer biointerface elaborated on the model system such as the biointerface between breast epithelial MCF-10A cells and cancer MDA-MB-231 cells and then to incorporate these parameters into a new biophysical model that could describe the dynamics of the biointerface. We conclude by discussing three biophysical scenarios for cell dynamics along the biointerface, which can occur depending on the magnitude of the generated shear stress: a smooth biointerface, a slightly-perturbed biointerface and an intensively-perturbed biointerface in the context of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. These scenarios are related to the probability of cancer invasion.',\n"," 'Engineered human pluripotent stem cell-derived natural killer cells with PD-L1 responsive immunological memory for enhanced immunotherapeutic efficacy.Adoptive chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered natural killer (NK) cells have shown promise in treating various cancers. However, limited immunological memory and access to sufficient numbers of allogenic donor cells have hindered their broader preclinical and clinical applications. Here, we first assess eight different CAR constructs that use an anti-PD-L1 nanobody and/or universal anti-fluorescein (FITC) single-chain variable fragment (scFv) to enhance antigen-specific proliferation and anti-tumor cytotoxicity of NK-92\\xa0cells against heterogenous solid tumors. We next genetically engineer human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) with optimized CARs and differentiate them into functional dual CAR-NK cells. The tumor microenvironment responsive anti-PD-L1 CAR effectively promoted hPSC-NK cell proliferation and cytotoxicity through antigen-dependent activation of phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) and pSTAT5 signaling pathways via an intracellular truncated IL-2 receptor β-chain (ΔIL-2Rβ) and STAT3-binding tyrosine-X-X-glutamine (YXXQ) motif. Anti-tumor activities of PD-L1-induced memory-like hPSC-NK cells were further boosted by administering a FITC-folate bi-specific adapter that bridges between a programmable anti-FITC CAR and folate receptor alpha-expressing breast tumor cells. Collectively, our hPSC CAR-NK engineering platform is modular and could constitute a realistic strategy to manufacture off-the-shelf CAR-NK cells with immunological memory-like phenotype for targeted immunotherapy.',\n"," 'Multi-vendor robustness analysis of a commercial artificial intelligence system for breast cancer detection.PURPOSE: Population-based screening programs for the early detection of breast cancer have significantly reduced mortality in women, but they are resource intensive in terms of time, cost, and workload and still have limitations mainly due to the use of 2D imaging techniques, which may cause overlapping of tissues, and interobserver variability. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems may be a valuable tool to assist radiologist when reading and classifying mammograms based on the malignancy of the detected lesions. However, there are several factors that can influence the outcome of a mammogram and thus also the detection capability of an AI system. The aim of our work is to analyze the robustness of the diagnostic ability of an AI system designed for breast cancer detection. APPROACH: Mammograms from a population-based screening program were scored with the AI system. The sensitivity and specificity by means of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were obtained as a function of the mammography unit manufacturer, demographic characteristics, and several factors that may affect the image quality (age, breast thickness and density, compression applied, beam quality, and delivered dose). RESULTS: The area under the curve (AUC) from the scoring ROC curve was 0.92 (95% confidence interval = 0.89 - 0.95). It showed no dependence with any of the parameters considered, as the differences in the AUC for different interval values were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the AI system analyzed in our work has a robust diagnostic capability, and that its accuracy is independent of the studied parameters.',\n"," 'A self-monitoring microneedle patch for light-controlled synergistic treatment of melanoma.Melanoma is the most aggressive and malignant form of skin cancer. Current melanoma treatment methods generally suffer from frequent drug administration as well as difficulty in direct monitoring of drug release. Here, a self-monitoring microneedle (MN)-based drug delivery system, which integrates a dissolving MN patch with aggregation-induced emission (AIE)-active PATC microparticles, is designed to achieve light-controlled pulsatile chemo-photothermal synergistic therapy of melanoma. The PATC polymeric particles, termed D/I@PATC, encapsulate both of chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX) and the photothermal agent indocyanine green (ICG). Upon light illumination, PATC gradually dissociates into smaller particles, causing the release of encapsulated DOX and subsequent fluorescence intensity change of PATC particles, thereby not only enabling direct observation of the drug release process under light stimuli, but also facilitating verification of drug release by fluorescence recovery after light trigger. Moreover, encapsulation of ICG in PATC particles displays significant improvement of its photothermal stability both in vitro and in vivo. In a tumor-bearing mouse, the application of one D/I@PATC MN patch combining with two cycles of light irradiation showed excellent controllable chemo-photothermal efficacy and exhibited ∼97% melanoma inhibition rate without inducing any evident systemic toxicity, suggesting a great potential for skin cancer treatment in clinics.',\n"," 'An ultrasensitive label-free fluorescent aptamer sensor based on pH-gated release coumarin for detect HER2.Evaluation of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) molecular markers is a very suitable option for early diagnosis of breast cancer. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have large porosity and surface interactions such as π-π stacking, electrostatics, hydrogen bonding, and coordination. Here, we integrated the HER2 aptamer and fluorescent probe coumarin (COU) with zeolite imidazolic acid framework-8 (ZIF-8) to construct a label-free fluorescent aptamer sensor with pH-gated release of COU. In the presence of the target-HER2, the aptamer adsorbed on the surface of ZIF-8@COU specifically recognizes and falls off the HER2 protein, exposing a portion of the pore size of ZIF-8@COU while reducing the negative charge on the sensor surface, under alkaline hydrolysis conditions, a large number of COU fluorescent molecules can be produced and released in the detection system.The aptamer fluorescence sensor has good detection performance, sensitivity and low background interference, the detection linearity range of HER2 protein is 0.05-10\\xa0ng/mL, the detection limit is 0.0005\\xa0ng/mL, and it has good recovery rate for the serum detection of clinical breast cancer patients. Therefore, this sensor has high potential in detecting and monitoring HER2 levels for the care and clinical diagnosis of breast cancer patients.',\n"," 'Dual probe difference specimen imaging for prostate cancer margin assessment.SIGNIFICANCE: Positive margin status due to incomplete removal of tumor tissue during radical prostatectomy for high-risk localized prostate cancer requires reoperation or adjuvant therapy, which increases morbidity and mortality. Adverse effects of prostate cancer treatments commonly include erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, and bowel dysfunction, making successful initial curative prostatectomy imperative. AIM: Current intraoperative tumor margin assessment is largely limited to frozen section analysis, which is a lengthy, labor-intensive process that is obtrusive to the clinical workflow within the operating room (OR). Therefore, a rapid method for prostate cancer margin assessment in the OR could improve outcomes for patients. APPROACH: Dual probe difference specimen imaging (DDSI), which uses paired antibody-based probes that are labeled with spectrally distinct fluorophores, was shown herein for prostate cancer margin assessment. The paired antibody-based probes consisted of a targeted probe to prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and an untargeted probe, which were used as a cocktail to stain resected murine tissue specimens including prostate tumor, adipose, muscle, and normal prostate. Ratiometric images (i.e., DDSI) of the difference between targeted and untargeted probe uptake were calculated and evaluated for accuracy using receiver operator characteristic curve analysis with area under the curve values used to evaluate the utility of the DDSI method to detect PSMA positive prostate cancer. RESULTS: Targeted and untargeted probe uptake was similar between the high and low PSMA expressing tumor due to nonspecific probe uptake after topical administration. The ratiometric DDSI approach showed substantial contrast difference between the PSMA positive tumors and their respective normal tissues (prostate, adipose, muscle). Furthermore, DDSI showed substantial contrast difference between the high PSMA expressing tumors and the minimally PSMA expressing tumors due to the ratiometric correction for the nonspecific uptake patterns in resected tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Previous work has shown that ratiometic imaging has strong predictive value for breast cancer margin status using topical administration. Translation of the ratiometric DDSI methodology herein from breast to prostate cancers demonstrates it as a robust, ratiometric technique that provides a molecularly specific imaging modality for intraoperative margin detection. Using the validated DDSI protocol on resected prostate cancers permitted rapid and accurate assessment of PSMA status as a surrogate for prostate cancer margin status. Future studies will further evaluate the utility of this technology to quantitatively characterize prostate margin status using PSMA as a biomarker.',\n"," 'Enzyme-triggered deep tumor penetration of a dual-drug nanomedicine enables an enhanced cancer combination therapy.Cancer cells could be eradicated by promoting generation of excessive intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) via emerging nanomedicines. However, tumor heterogeneity and poor penetration of nanomedicines often lead to diverse levels of ROS production in the tumor site, and ROS at a low level promote tumor cell growth, thus diminishing the therapeutic effect of these nanomedicines. Herein, we construct an amphiphilic and block polymer-dendron conjugate-derived nanomedicine (Lap@pOEGMA-b-p(GFLG-Dendron-Ppa), GFLG-DP/Lap NPs) that incorporates a photosensitizer, Pyropheophorbide a (Ppa), for ROS therapy and Lapatinib (Lap) for molecular targeted therapy. Lap, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor that plays a role in inhibiting cell growth and proliferation, is hypothesized to synergize with ROS therapy for effectively killing cancer cells. Our results suggest that the enzyme-sensitive polymeric conjugate, pOEGMA-b-p(GFLG-Dendron-Ppa) (GFLG-DP), releases in response to cathepsin B (CTSB) after entering the tumor tissue. Dendritic-Ppa has a strong adsorption capacity to tumor cell membranes, which promotes efficient penetration and long-term retention. Lap can also be efficiently delivered to internal tumor cells to play its role due to the increased vesicle activity. Laser irradiation of Ppa-containing tumor cells results in production of intracellular ROS that is sufficient for inducing cell apoptosis. Meanwhile, Lap efficiently inhibits proliferation of remaining viable cells even in deep tumor regions, thus generating a significant synergistic anti-tumor therapeutic effect. This novel strategy can be extended to the development of efficient membrane lipid-based therapies to effectively combat tumors.',\n"," 'Jaboticaba (Myrciaria jaboticaba) peel extracts induce reticulum stress and apoptosis in breast cancer cells.Jaboticaba peel (Myrciaria jaboticaba) is a source of bioactive compounds. We investigated the anticancer activity of ethyl acetate extract (JE1) and hydroethanolic extract (JE2) of Jaboticaba peel against breast cancer. Both JE1 and JE2 inhibited clonogenic potential of MDA-MB-231 cells while JE1 was particularly effective in MCF7 cells. Anchorage-independent growth and cell viability was also inhibited by JE1 and JE2. In addition to growth inhibition, JE1 and JE2 could also inhibit migration and invasion of cells. Interestingly, JE1 and JE2 show selective inhibition towards certain breast cancer cells and biological processes. Mechanistic evaluations showed that JE1 induced PARP cleavage, BAX and BIP indicating apoptotic induction. An elevation of phosphorylated ERK was observed in MCF7 cells in response to JE1 and JE2 along with increased IRE-α and CHOP expression indicating increased endoplasmic stress. Therefore, Jaboticaba peel extracts could be potentially considered for further development for breast cancer inhibition.',\n"," \"Breast cancer cell growth arrest and chemopreventive effects of Passiflora edulis Sims (Passifloraceae) ethanolic leaves extract on a rat model of mammary carcinoma.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Despite various prevention and treatment measures, the incidence and mortality due to breast cancer has been increasing globally. Passiflora edulis Sims is a plant used for the treatment of various diseases in traditional medicine, including cancers. AIM OF THE STUDY: To assess the anti-breast cancer activity of the ethanolic extract of P. edulis leaves in vitro and in vivo. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In vitro, the cell growth and proliferation were determined based on the MTT and BrdU assays. The flow cytometry was used to analyze the cell death mechanism while, cell migration, cell adhesion and chemotaxis were assayed for anti-metastatic potential. In vivo, 56 female Wistar rats aged 45-50 days (∼75\\xa0g) were exposed to 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene-DMBA except the normal group. Negative control group (DMBA) received solvent dilution throughout the study; standards groups (tamoxifen - 3.3\\xa0mg/kg BW and letrozole - 1\\xa0mg/kg BW) as well as P. edulis leaves ethanolic extract groups (50, 100 and 200\\xa0mg/kg) treated for 20 weeks. Tumor incidence, tumor burden and volume, CA 15-3 serum' level, antioxidant, inflammatory status and histopathology were assessed. RESULTS: P. edulis extract showed a significant and concentration-dependent inhibition of MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231\\xa0cells growth at 100\\xa0μg/mL. It inhibited cell proliferation and clones' formation and induced apoptosis in MDA-MB 231\\xa0cells. The migration of cell into the zone freed of cells and the number of invading cells after the 48 and 72\\xa0h were significantly diminished while, it increased their adherence to collagen and fibronectin extracellular matrix as does Doxorubicin. In vivo, all rats in the DMBA group exhibited a significant (p < 0.001) increase in tumor volume, tumor burden and grade (adenocarcinoma of SBR III) and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (TNF-α, INF-γ, IL-6 and IL-12). P. edulis extract at all tested doses significantly inhibited the DMBA-induced increase in tumor incidence, tumor burden and grade (SBR I) as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, it increased enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants (SOD, catalase, and GSH) and decreased MDA levels although a greater effect was observed with Tamoxifen and Letrozole. P. edulis has medium content on polyphenols, flavonoids and tannins. CONCLUSION: P. edulis has chemo-preventive effects against DMBA-induced breast cancer in rats probably through its antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and apoptosis-inducing potentials.\",\n"," 'Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio Is Associated With the Proportion of Poorly Differentiated Components in Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma.INTRODUCTION: Diagnosis of poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (PDTC) requires ≥ 50% of poorly differentiated components (PDC) in Japan. However, the optimal cutoff percentage of PDC for PDTC diagnosis remains controversial. Although high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) correlates with the aggressiveness of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), whether NLR is associated with the proportion of PDC in PTC remains unstudied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with the pure PTC (n\\xa0=\\xa0664), PTC with < 50% PDC (n\\xa0=\\xa019), or PTC with ≥ 50% PDC (n\\xa0=\\xa026) who underwent surgery were retrospectively analyzed. Twelve-year disease-specific survival and preoperative NLR were compared among these groups. RESULTS: Twenty seven patients died from thyroid cancer. The PTC with ≥ 50% PDC group (80.7%) showed significantly worse 12-year disease-specific survival than the pure PTC group (97.2%) (P\\xa0<\\xa00.001); however, the < 50% PDC group (94.7%) did not (P\\xa0=\\xa00.91). The PTC with ≥ 50% PDC group had a significantly higher NLR than the pure PTC (P\\xa0<\\xa00.001) and the PTC with < 50% PDC groups (P\\xa0<\\xa00.001), whereas there was no significant difference in the NLR between the pure PTC and the PTC with < 50% PDC groups (P\\xa0=\\xa00.48). CONCLUSIONS: PTC with ≥ 50% PDC is more aggressive than either pure PTC or PTC with < 50% PDC, and NLR potentially reflects the PDC proportion. These results support the validity of 50% PDC as a cut-off for PDTC diagnosis and indicate the utility of NLR as a biomarker for PDC proportion.',\n"," 'Co-delivery of gemcitabine and paclitaxel plus NanoCpG empowers chemoimmunotherapy of postoperative \"cold\" triple-negative breast cancer.Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) due to lack of clear target and notorious \"cold\" tumor microenvironment (TME) is one of the most intractable and lethal malignancies. Tuning \"cold\" TME into \"hot\" becomes an emerging therapeutic strategy to TNBC. Herewith, we report that integrin-targeting micellar gemcitabine and paclitaxel (ATN-mG/P, ATN sequence: Ac-PhScNK-NH(2)) cooperating with polymersomal CpG (NanoCpG) effectively \"heated up\" and treated TNBC. ATN-mG/P exhibited greatly boosted apoptotic activity in 4T1 cells, induced potent immunogenic cell death (ICD), and efficiently stimulated maturation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs). Remarkably, in a postoperative TNBC model, ATN-mG/P combining with NanoCpG promoted strong anti-cancer immune responses, showing a greatly augmented proportion of mature DCs and CD8(+) T cells while reduced immune-suppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T cells (T(reg)), which led to complete inhibition of lung metastasis and 60% mice tumor-free. The co-delivery of gemcitabine and paclitaxel at desired ratio in combination with NanoCpG provides a unique platform for potent chemoimmunotherapy of \"cold\" tumors like TNBC.',\n"," 'A randomized controlled study to compare analgesic efficacy of sublingual buprenorphine and intravenous tramadol in patients undergoing mastectomy.Sublingual (SL) buprenorphine is approved for managing acute postoperative pain, characterized by easy administration, good pain relief and good patient compliance. We hypothesized that SL buprenorphine would be a better perioperative analgesic compared to intravenous (IV) opioids like tramadol in patients undergoing mastectomy surgery for breast cancer. After institutional ethics committee approval, we randomized 60 patients with breast cancer into 2 groups. In buprenorphine group, patients received 200 μg of SL buprenorphine thrice daily and in tramadol group patients received 100 mg of IV tramadol thrice daily. The analgesic efficacy of SL buprenorphine was comparable to that of IV tramadol. Visual Analogue Scale scores had no significant difference between the two groups at various time frames (0, 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 hours) at rest and movement except at 0 and 3 hours during movement when the score was lower in the tramadol group than the buprenorphine group. Four patients in the buprenorphine group received rescue analgesic (IV morphine 3 mg). Analgesic efficacy of SL buprenorphine appears comparable to IV tramadol for managing postoperative pain after mastectomy. SL buprenorphine can be administered sublingually, which is an advantage.',\n"," 'Molecular signaling network and therapeutic developments in breast cancer brain metastasis.Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers in women worldwide. It has surpassed lung cancer as the leading cause of cancer-related death. Breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) is becoming a major clinical concern that is commonly associated with ER-ve and HER2+ve subtypes of BC patients. Metastatic lesions in the brain originate when the cancer cells detach from a primary breast tumor and establish metastatic lesions and infiltrate near and distant organs via systemic blood circulation by traversing the BBB. The colonization of BC cells in the brain involves a complex interplay in the tumor microenvironment (TME), metastatic cells, and brain cells like endothelial cells, microglia, and astrocytes. BCBM is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality and presents a challenge to developing successful cancer therapy. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanism of BCBM and novel therapeutic strategies for patients with brain metastatic BC.',\n"," 'Curcumol, a major terpenoid from Curcumae Rhizoma, attenuates human uterine leiomyoma cell development via the p38MAPK/NF-κB pathway.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Uterine fibroids (UFs) are the most common benign tumors in women of reproductive age. Curcumae Rhizoma, the main essential oil component of which is curcumol, is widely used for the treatment of phymatosis in China due to its antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antithrombin, anti-tissue fibrosis and anti-oxygen pharmacological activities, but its potential for the treatment of UFs has not been evaluated. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of curcumol intervention in human uterine leiomyoma cells (UMCs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Putative targets of curcumol intervention in UFs were identified using network pharmacology strategies. Molecular docking was performed to assess the binding affinity of curcumol to core targets. A concentration gradient of curcumol (0, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500\\xa0μM) or RU-486 (mifepristone, 0, 10, 20, 40, 50, and 100\\xa0μM) was applied to UMCs, and cell viability was detected by the CCK-8 assay. Cell apoptosis and cell cycle were examined by flow cytometry, and cell migration was assessed by a wound-healing assay. Additionally, the mRNA and protein expression levels of critical pathway components were evaluated by RT‒PCR and western blotting. Finally, the actions of curcumol on different tumor cell lines were summarized. RESULTS: Network pharmacology predicted 62 genes with roles in the treatment of UFs with curcumol, and MAPK14 (p38MAPK) displayed a higher interaction degree. GO enrichment and KEGG analyses revealed that the core genes were abundantly enriched in the MAPK signaling pathway. The molecular binding of curcumol to core targets was relatively stable. In UMCs, 200, 300 and 400\\xa0μM curcumol treatment for 24\\xa0h decreased cell viability compared with that in the control group, and the greatest effect was detected at 48\\xa0h and maintained until 72\\xa0h. Curcumol arrested cells in the G0/G1 phase and subsequently suppressed mitosis, promoted early apoptosis and reduced the degree of wound healing in a concentration-dependent manner in UMCs. Furthermore, 200\\xa0μM curcumol decreased the mRNA and protein expression of p38MAPK, the mRNA expression of NF-κB, and the protein expression of Ki-67 and increased the mRNA and protein expression of Caspase 9. Curcumol (300 and 400\\xa0μM) decreased the mRNA and protein expression of p38MAPK, NF-κB, and Ki-67 and increased the protein expression of Caspase 9 in UMCs. Curcumol was demonstrated to treat tumor cell lines, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer, liver cancer and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, but its effects on benign tumors have not yet been reported. CONCLUSION: Curcumol suppresses cell proliferation and cell migration while arresting the cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase and inducing cell apoptosis in UMCs via a mechanism related to p38MAPK/NF-κB pathway regulation. Curcumol may be a potential therapeutic and preventive agent in the treatment of benign tumors such as UFs.',\n"," 'Manganese oxide-modified bismuth oxychloride piezoelectric nanoplatform with multiple enzyme-like activities for cancer sonodynamic therapy.Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is considered as a new-rising strategy for cancer therapeutics, but the inefficient production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by current sonosensitizers seriously hinders its further applications. Herein, a piezoelectric nanoplatform is fabricated for enhancing SDT against cancer, in which manganese oxide (MnO(x)) with multiple enzyme-like activities is loaded on the surface of piezoelectric bismuth oxychloride nanosheets (BiOCl NSs) to form a heterojunction. When exposed to ultrasound (US) irradiation, piezotronic effect can remarkably promote the separation and transport of US-induced free charges, and further enhance ROS generation in SDT. Meanwhile, the nanoplatform shows multiple enzyme-like activities from MnO(x), which can not only downregulate the intracellular glutathione (GSH) level, but also disintegrate endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) to generate oxygen (O(2)) and hydroxyl radicals (•OH). As a result, the anticancer nanoplatform substantially boosts ROS generation and reverses tumor hypoxia. Ultimately, it reveals remarkable biocompatibility and tumor suppression in a murine model of 4\\xa0T1 breast cancer under US irradiation. This work provides a feasible pathway for improving SDT using piezoelectric platforms.',\n"," 'Breast cancer screening programmes and self-reported mammography use in European countries.Mammography screening has been shown to be able to reduce breast cancer mortality, leading most European countries to implement mammography-based screening programmes. In our study, we analysed key characteristics of breast cancer screening programmes and mammography use in European countries. Information on screening programmes were obtained from the 2017 European Union (EU) screening report, websites from governments and cancer registries, and through literature search in PubMed (studies published up to 20 June 2022). Data on self-reported mammography use in the past 2\\u2009years were obtained from Eurostat and had been derived from the European health interview survey (cross-sectional survey), conducted in the 27 EU countries, Iceland, Norway, Serbia, Turkey and the UK in 2013 to 2015 and 2018 to 2020. Data were analysed for each country according to their human development index (HDI). By 2022, all included countries besides Bulgaria and Greece had introduced an organised mammography-based screening programme; Romania and Turkey had only pilot programmes. Screening programmes differ substantially across countries, particularly in timing of implementation (e.g., in Sweden, the Netherlands before 1990; Belgium, France between 2000 and 2004; Denmark, Germany between 2005 and 2009; Austria, Slovakia after 2010). Self-reported mammography use also differed considerably across countries, and went along with HDI-from <36% in all countries with HDI <0.85 to >70% in most countries with HDI >0.90. The data call for efforts to improve mammography screening use across Europe, particularly in countries with lower development levels where breast cancer mortality rates are also among the highest in the region.',\n"," 'Differential optineurin expression controls TGFβ signaling and is a key determinant for metastasis of triple negative breast cancer.Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most challenging breast cancer subtype to treat due to its aggressive characteristics and low response to the existing clinical therapies. Distant metastasis is the main cause of death of TNBC patients. Better understanding of the mechanisms underlying TNBC metastasis may lead to new strategies of early diagnosis and more efficient treatment. In our study, we uncovered that the autophagy receptor optineurin (OPTN) plays an unexpected role in TNBC metastasis. Data mining of publicly available data bases revealed that the mRNA level of OPTN in TNBC patients positively correlates with relapse free and distance metastasis free survival. Importantly, in vitro and in vivo models demonstrated that OPTN suppresses TNBC metastasis. Mechanistically, OPTN inhibited the pro-oncogenic transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) signaling in TNBC cells by interacting with TGFβ type I receptor (TβRI) and promoting its ubiquitination for degradation. Consistent with our experimental findings, the clinical TNBC samples displayed a negative correlation between OPTN mRNA expression and TGFβ gene response signature and expression of proto-typic TGFβ target genes. Altogether, our study demonstrates that OPTN is a negative regulator for TGFβ receptor/SMAD signaling and suppresses metastasis in TNBC.',\n"," 'The effect of cognitive behavioural therapy integrated with activity pacing on cancer-related fatigue, depression and quality of life among patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy in Ethiopia: A randomised clinical trial.Fatigue is a common symptom experienced by 80% of individuals who receive chemotherapy and is one of the major factors that affect quality of life (QoL) of patients with breast cancer. Our study aimed to assess the effect of cognitive behavioural therapy integrated with activity pacing (CBT-AP) on cancer-related fatigue among patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. A parallel-group, randomised controlled trial was conducted. Severely fatigued patients were randomly assigned to the CBT-AP or usual care (UC) groups using a computer-generated random sequence. The new intervention was designed for seven sessions: three 2-hour face-to-face and four 30-minute telephone sessions. The primary outcome (fatigue severity) and the secondary outcomes (depression and QoL) were assessed at the end of the intervention and after 3\\xa0months. The data were analysed by repeated measures analyses of covariance (RM-ANCOVA). CBT-AP had a significant time effect (P\\u2009<\\u2009.001, ηp(2) \\xa0=\\xa00.233) in reducing fatigue from baseline (adjusted mean\\xa0=\\xa07.48) to the end of the intervention (adjusted mean\\xa0=\\xa06.37) and the 3-month follow-up (adjusted mean\\xa0=\\xa06.54). Compared to the UC group, the CBT-AP group had lower fatigue and depression scores, and higher global health status scores. The group × time interaction revealed a significant reduction in fatigue and depression in the CBT-AP group compared to the UC group. Therefore, CBT-AP appears to be effective in reducing fatigue and depression and improving QoL in patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. It is highly recommended to integrate a CBT-AP intervention in routine cancer care.',\n"," 'Advances in \"adiponcosis\": Insights in the inner mechanisms at the base of adipose and tumour tissues interplay.The epidemic spread of obesity is nowadays recognized as a global health and economic burden, arising great interest in the scientific community. The rate of adult obesity steadily increases concomitantly with the cancer incidence. As has been comprehensively reported, obesity is included among the multiple cancer risk factors and can progressively cause and/or exacerbate certain cancer types, as colorectal and breast cancers. The term adiponcosis was forged precisely to emphasize the interconnection between obesity and cancer onset and progression. The underlying mechanisms of adiponcosis have not been fully elucidated yet, may vary on cancer type, and depend on body fat distribution. It has been proposed that insulin resistance and related chronic hyperinsulinemia, increased insulin-like growth factors production, chronic inflammation or increased bioavailability of steroid hormones could be responsible of cancer hallmarks. Additionally, it has been suggested that adipose tissue-derived hormones, cytokines and adipokines, such as leptin, adiponectin and inflammatory markers, may reflect mechanisms linked to tumorigenesis. This review summarizes the current evidence on pathways, hormones, cytokines and low-chronic inflammation subtending adiponconsis, focusing on breast and colorectal cancers. In addition, we analyzed the lifestyle interventions that could attenuate the driving forces of obesity-related cancer incidence and progression. Moreover, current targets and drugs, their pros and cons, as well as new mechanisms and targets with promising therapeutic potential in cancer are discussed. Depicting this complex interconnection will provide insights for establishing new therapeutic approaches to halt the obesity impacts and thwart cancer onset and progression.',\n"," 'Spectroscopic studies on noncovalent binding of nicotinamide-modified BRCA1 (856-871) analogs to calf thymus DNA.Various peptide drugs have entered the market with the development of molecular biology. Peptide drugs are used for treat diseases such as diabetes, breast cancer, and HIV infection. In this study, three nicotinamide-modified peptides were synthesized by modifying the N-terminus of BRCA1 (856-871, Y856R, K862Y, R866W) peptide with three nicotinic acid derivatives using solid-phase peptide synthesis. The results of calf thymus DNA (ctDNA) binding activity indicated that binding constants of BRCA1 (856-871, Y856R, K862Y, R866W) (P0) and three nicotinamide-modified peptides (P1, P2, and P3) to ctDNA were 1.89\\xa0×\\xa010(3), 2.97\\xa0×\\xa010(4), 7.61\\xa0×\\xa010(4), and 8.09\\xa0×\\xa010(4) L·mol(-1), respectively. The binding affinity of the modified peptides was superior to that of BRCA1 (856-871, Y856R, K862Y, R866W). ΔH(θ)\\xa0<\\xa00 and ΔS(θ)\\xa0<\\xa00 indicated that van der Waals force and hydrogen bond contributed most to peptide-ctDNA binding. Results obtained by Circular dichroism (CD) indicated that peptide binding interaction led to conformational changes in ctDNA. Ultraviolet-visible (UV) spectroscopy, ethidium bromide (EB) competition experiments, DNA melting experiments, and viscosity measurements verified that peptides interacted with ctDNA via groove binding. Ionic strength experiments manifested that electrostatic binding was also involved in peptide-ctDNA binding.',\n"," 'Pyridinic-N-rich carbon dots in IFE-based Turn-off Fluorometric detection of nerve agent Mimic- Diethyl chlorophosphate and multicolor cell imaging.Fluorometric sensors for the detection of nerve agent mimics have received a lot of interest nowadays due to their high sensitivity and selectivity, ease of operation, and real-time monitoring. Pyridinic-N-rich carbon dots (NCDs) prepared through microwave-assisted pyrolysis of l-Malic acid and urea have been explored first time in this work as a novel turn-off fluorescent probe for the sensitive and selective detection of diethyl chlorophosphate (DCP), a nerve agent mimic. The as-prepared carbon dots contained a large amount of pyridinic nitrogen on their surface, which can modulate the photoluminescence properties of the NCDs. The blue emissive NCDs possessed both excitation wavelength-dependent and independent emission behavior. The detection of DCP was premised on quenching of the fluorescence emission intensity of NCDs in the presence of similar chemical reagents (e.g., trimethyl phosphate, triethyl phosphate, triethyl phosphonoacetate, triphenyl phosphate, diphenyl phosphate, tributyl phosphate). Fluorescence quenching of the NCDs in the presence of DCP has been attributed to the inner filter effect (IFE). From the linear Stern-Volmer plot (R(2)\\xa0=\\xa00.9992), the limit of detection (LOD) was found to be 84\\xa0μM for sensing DCP for the concentration ranging between 3 and 15\\xa0mM. The biocompatibility of NCDs was assessed through cytotoxicity assay on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Fluorescence imaging demonstrated that NCDs have low cytotoxicity and can be employed successfully in cell imaging.',\n"," \"[Retracted] TGF‑β1 induces peritoneal fibrosis by activating the Smad2 pathway in mesothelial cells and promotes peritoneal carcinomatosis.Following the publication of this paper, it was drawn to the Editor's attention by a concerned reader that the fluorescence microscopy data shown in Fig.\\xa06A and B were strikingly similar to data appearing in different form in Fig.\\xa07 in a previously published paper [Lv\\xa0Z‑D, Na\\xa0D, Liu\\xa0F‑N, Du\\xa0Z‑M, Sun\\xa0Z, Li Z, Ma\\xa0X‑Y, Wang\\xa0Z‑N and Xu\\xa0H‑M: Induction of gastric cancer cell adhesion through transforming growth factor‑beta1‑mediated peritoneal fibrosis.

Most studies have focused on the function of TXN in redox reactions, which is critical for tumor progression. Here, we showed that TXN promotes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) stemness properties in a non-redox-dependent manner, which has rarely been reported in previous studies. TXN exhibited upregulated expression in human HCC specimens, which was associated with a poor prognosis. Functional studies showed that TXN promoted HCC stemness properties and facilitated HCC metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, TXN promoted the stemness of HCC cells by interacting with BTB and CNC homology 1 (BACH1) and stabilized BACH1 expression by inhibiting its ubiquitination. BACH1 was positively correlated with TXN expression and was significantly upregulated in HCC. In addition, BACH1 promotes HCC stemness by activating the AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Furthermore, we found that the specific inhibition of TXN in combination with lenvatinib in mice significantly improved the treatment of metastatic HCC. In summary, our data demonstrate that TXN plays a crucial role in HCC stemness and BACH1 plays an integral part in regulating this process by activating the AKT/mTOR pathway. Thus, TXN is a promising target for metastatic HCC therapy.',\n"," 'Near-infrared fluorescence angiography with indocyanine green for perfusion assessment of DIEP and msTRAM flaps: A Dutch multicenter randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: A common complication after a DIEP flap reconstruction is the occurrence of fat necrosis due to inadequate flap perfusion zones. Intraoperative identification of ischemic zones in the DIEP flap could be optimized using indocyanine green near-infrared fluorescence angiography (ICG-NIR-FA). This randomized controlled trial aims to determine whether intraoperative ICG-NIR-FA for the assessment of DIEP flap perfusion decreases the occurrence of fat necrosis. DESIGN/METHODS: This article describes the protocol of a Dutch multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial: the FAFI-trial. Females who are electively scheduled for autologous breast reconstruction using DIEP or muscle-sparing transverse rectus abdominis muscle (msTRAM) flaps are included. A total of 280 patients will be included in a 1:1 ratio between both study arms. In the intervention arm, the intraoperative assessment of flap perfusion will be based on both regular clinical parameters and ICG-NIR-FA. The control arm consists of flap perfusion evaluation only through the regular clinical parameters, while ICG-NIR-FA images are obtained during surgery for which the surgeon is blinded. The main study endpoint is the difference in percentage of clinically relevant fat necrosis between both study arms, evaluated two weeks and three months after reconstruction. CONCLUSION: The FAFI-trial, a Dutch multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial, aims to investigate the clinical added value of intraoperative use of standardized ICG-NIR-FA for assessment of DIEP/msTRAM flap perfusion in the reduction of fat necrosis.

Metastasis to the gastrointestinal system is rare and can occur years after breast cancer diagnosis. This case report features a woman who was diagnosed with infiltrating ductal carcinoma 10 years ago and was discovered to have stomach metastasis this year. Immunohistochemical staining was employed to distinguish the metastasis from primary gastric cancer.

EL is a potential nutraceutical, with several health benefits, including anticancer and antimetastatic properties. Epidemiological data suggest a possible link between EL exposure and breast cancer risk. However, EL binds to estrogen receptor-α, produces estrogen-like effects on gene expression, and induces proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells at a concentration of 10 µM. Here, we present RNA-seq data obtained from MCF-7 breast cancer cells treated with 10 µM EL for a period of 72 h, which captures the transcriptomic alterations associated with cell proliferation. The data are available from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, accession number GSE216876).',\n"," 'Potential roles and molecular mechanisms of bioactive ingredients in Curcumae Rhizoma against breast cancer.BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer worldwide, with high morbidity and mortality. Despite great advances in the therapeutic strategies, the survival rate in the past decades of patients with breast cancer remains unsatisfactory. Growing evidence has demonstrated that Curcumae Rhizoma, called Ezhu in Chinese, showed various pharmacological properties, including anti-bacterial, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor activities. It has been widely used in Chinese medicine to treat many types of human cancer. PURPOSE: To comprehensively summarize and analyze the effects of active substances in Curcumae Rhizoma on breast cancer malignant phenotypes and the underlying mechanisms, as well as discuss its medicinal value and future perspectives. METHOD: We used \"Curcumae Rhizoma\" or the name of crude extracts and bioactive components in Curcumae Rhizoma in combination with \"breast cancer\" as key words. Studies focusing on their anti-breast cancer activities and mechanisms of action were extracted from Pubmed, Web of Science and CNKI databases up to October 2022. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guideline was followed. RESULTS: Crude extracts and 7 main bioactive phytochemicals (curcumol, β-elemene, furanodiene, furanodienone, germacrone, curdione and curcumin) isolated from Curcumae Rhizoma have shown many anti-breast cancer pharmacological properties, including inhibiting cell proliferation, migration, invasion and stemness, reversing chemoresistance, and inducing cell apoptosis, cycle arrest and ferroptosis. The mechanisms of action were involved in regulating MAPK, PI3K/AKT and NF-κB signaling pathways. In vivo and clinical studies demonstrated that these compounds exhibited high anti-tumor efficacy and safety against breast cancer. CONCLUSION: These findings provide strong evidence that Curcumae Rhizoma acts as a rich source of phytochemicals and has robust anti-breast cancer properties.',\n"," 'Panax notoginseng saponins normalises tumour blood vessels by inhibiting EphA2 gene expression to modulate the tumour microenvironment of breast cancer.BACKGROUND: Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS), the main active component of Panax notoginseng, can promote vascular microcirculation. PNS exhibits antitumor effects in various cancers. However, the molecular basis of the relationship between PNS and tumor blood vessels remains unclear. PURPOSE: To study the relationship between PNS inhibiting the growth and metastasis of breast cancer and promoting the normalization of blood vessels. METHODS: We performed laser speckle imaging of tumor microvessels and observed the effects of PNS on tumor growth and metastasis of MMTV-PyMT (FVB) spontaneous breast cancer in a transgenic mouse model. Immunohistochemical staining of Ki67 and CD31 was performed for tumors, scanning electron microscopy was used to observe tumor vascular morphology, and flow cytometry was used to detect tumor tissue immune microenvironment (TME). RNA-seq analysis was performed using the main vessels of the tumor tissues of the mice. HUVECs were cultured in tumor supernatant in vitro to simulate tumor microenvironment and verify the sequencing differential key genes. RESULTS: After treatment with PNS, we observed that tumor growth was suppressed, the blood perfusion of the systemic tumor microvessels in the mice increased, and the number of lung metastases decreased. Moreover, the vascular density of the primary tumor increased, and the vascular epidermis was smoother and flatter. Moreover, the number of tumor-associated macrophages in the tumor microenvironment was reduced, and the expression levels of IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α were reduced in the tumor tissues. PNS downregulated the expression of multiple genes associated with tumor angiogenesis, migration, and adhesion. In vitro tubule formation experiments revealed that PNS promoted the formation and connection of tumor blood vessels and normalized the vessel morphology primarily by inhibiting EphA2 expression. In addition, PNS inhibited the expression of tumor vascular marker proteins and vascular migration adhesion-related proteins in vivo. CONCLUSION: In this study, we found that PNS promoted the generation and connection of tumor vascular endothelial cells, revealing the key role of EphA2 in endothelial cell adhesion and tumor blood vessel morphology. PNS can inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of breast cancer by inhibiting EphA2, improving the immune microenvironment of breast cancer and promoting the normalization of tumor blood vessels.',\n"," 'Role of the voltage‑gated sodium channel Nav1.6 in glioma and candidate drugs screening.Gliomas remain a clinical challenge, common and fatal. Treatment of glioblastoma remains elusive, and researchers have focused on discovering new mechanisms and drugs. It has been well established that the expression of voltage‑gated sodium channels (VGSCs) is abnormally increased in numerous malignancies and, in general, is rarely expressed in the corresponding normal tissues. This suggests that ion channel activity appears to be associated with malignant progression of tumors. VGSCs remain largely unknown as to how their activity leads to an increase in cancer cell activity or invasiveness. Certain sodium ion channel subtypes (for instance, Nav1.5 and Nav1.7) are associated with metastasis and invasion in cancers including breast and colorectal cancers. A previous study by the authors explored the expression of certain ion channels in glioma, but there are few studies related to Nav1.6. The current study aimed to elucidate the expression and role of Nav1.6 in glioma and to screen potential drugs for the treatment of glioma by virtual screening and drug sensitivity analysis. Nav1.6 relative expression of mRNA and protein was determined by reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR and western blot analysis. Cell proliferation was determined by Cell Counting Kit‑8 assay. Cell migration was assessed by cellular wound healing assay. Cell invasion and apoptosis were detected by Transwell cell invasion assay and flow cytometry. Last but not least, FDA‑approved drugs were screened using virtual screening, molecular docking and NCI‑60 drug sensitivity analyses based on the expression and structure of Nav1.6. In glioma cells, Nav1.6 was significantly upregulated and expressed mostly in the cytoplasm and cell membrane; its expression was positively correlated with pathological grade. A172 and U251 cells exhibited reduced proliferation, migration and invasion when Nav1.6 expression was knocked down, and apoptosis was increased. TNF‑α (100\\xa0pg/ml) acting on glioma cells was found to upregulate the expression level of Nav1.6, and TNF‑α was involved in the process of Nav1.6 promoting malignant progression of glioma. Finally, certain FDA‑approved drugs were identified by virtual screening and drug sensitivity analysis. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated the expression and role of Nav1.6 in glioma and identified several FDA‑approved drugs that are highly correlated with Nav1.6 and could be candidate drugs for patients with glioma.',\n"," 'A review of nemorosone: Chemistry and biological properties.Nemorosone is a bicyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinol derivative originally isolated from Clusia spp. and it can be obtained through chemical synthesis employing different synthetic strategies. Since its discovery, it has attracted great attention both from a biological and chemical viewpoint. In the present article, we attempted to review various chemical and biological topics around nemorosone, with an emphasis on its antiproliferative activities. For this purpose, relevant data was collected from different scientific databases including Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus and ISI Web of Knowledge. This natural compound has shown activity against several types of malignancies such as leukemia, human colorectal, pancreatic, and breast cancer because it modulates multiple molecular pathways. Nemorosone has both cytostatic and cytotoxic activity and it also seems to induce apoptosis and ferroptosis. Additionally, it has antimicrobial capabilities against Gram-positive bacteria and parasites belonging to genus Leishmania. Its promising antiproliferative pre-clinical effects deserve further attention for anticancer and anti-parasitic drug development and translation to the clinic.',\n"," 'Ginsenoside Rh4 inhibits breast cancer growth through targeting histone deacetylase 2 to regulate immune microenvironment and apoptosis.High expression of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) is recognized as a marker of invasive breast cancer (BC). HDAC2 is not only responsible for enhancing tumor cell growth, development, and anti-apoptosis, but also plays a significant role in regulating PD-L1 on the surface of tumor cells. Continuous expression of PD-L1 allows tumor cells to escape immune surveillance. There is not much research on how HDAC2 affects the immune system in breast cancer. Ginsenoside Rh4 (Rh4) is a major rare saponin in heat-treated ginseng, which is widely applied in treating and preventing various diseases because of its potent medicinal value and stable safety. However, it is unclear how Rh4 affects the tumor immune microenvironment in breast cancer. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the effect of Rh4 on HDAC2 in breast cancer, specifically the effect of HDAC2 on apoptosis and the immune microenvironment to inhibit breast cancer growth. According to our study, ginsenoside Rh4 has been shown to significantly suppress breast cancer cell proliferation without any adverse effects. The molecular docking results of Rh4 and HDAC2 indicate a binding energy of -6.06\\xa0kcal/mol, suggesting the potential of Rh4 as a targeting modulator of HDAC2. Mechanistically, Rh4 induces apoptosis of breast cancer cells by the HDAC2-mediated caspase pathway and inhibits the HDAC2-mediated JAK/STAT pathway to regulate the immune microenvironment, which inhibits breast cancer growth. Specifically, Rh4 was shown for the first time to blockade immune checkpoints (PD-1/PD-L1) and increase levels of T-lymphocytes in the tumor. In a word, our study establishes a theoretical framework for applying Rh4 as an immune checkpoint inhibitor as part of breast cancer treatment.',\n"," \"Aqua polo: Preliminary feasibility and efficacy study of a programme of adapted, supervised water polo to reduce fatigue and improve women's psychological and social recovery after breast cancer treatment: A mixed-methods design.Physical activity has been shown to have many benefits, including reducing cancer-related fatigue (CRF) and improving psychological and physical recovery from breast cancer. Some authors have shown the benefits of aquatic practice, while others have detailed the benefits of group and supervised practice. We hypothesize that an innovative sports coaching proposal could allow a significant adherence of patients and contribute to their health improvement. The main objective is to study the feasibility of an adapted water polo programme (aqua polo) for women after breast cancer. Secondarily we will analyse the effect of such a practice on patients' recovery and study the relationship between coaches and participants. The use of mixed methods will allow us to question the underlying processes precisely. This is a prospective, non-randomized, monocentric study with a sample of 24 breast cancer patients after treatment. The intervention is a 20 week programme (1 session per week) of aqua polo in a swim club facility, supervised by professional water-polo coaches. The variables measured are patient participation, quality of life (QLQ BR23), CRF (R-PFS) and post-traumatic growth (PTG-I) as well as different variables to observe physical capacity (strength with dynamometer, step-test and arm amplitude). The quality of the coach-patient relationship will be evaluated (CART-Q) to explore its dynamics. Participatory observations and interviews will be carried out to report on the interactions between the coach and the participants during the sessions.

Despite durable responses, eventual endocrine resistance results in disease progression. The Src/Abl pathway has been shown to mediate endocrine resistance in breast cancer, thus providing a promising target for novel therapies. Bosutinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets the Src/Abl pathway, which has been studied in hematologic malignancies. Preclinical data suggests that the addition of bosutinib to a CDK4/6 inhibitor and antiestrogen therapy has the potential to reverse endocrine resistance. This is a phase I, single arm, open-label clinical trial in which we evaluate the combination of palbociclib and fulvestrant with bosutinib in metastatic HR+\\xa0breast cancer. Patients with confirmed advanced HR+/HER2- breast cancer who have received no more than three lines of chemotherapy and have progressed on at least one aromatase inhibitor and one CDK4/6 inhibitor will be enrolled. Participants will be given a combination of palbociclib, fulvestrant and bosutinib over 28-day cycles. The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of bosutinib in combination with palbociclib and fulvestrant in the study population. Secondary objectives are to 1) determine the anti-tumor effect of this therapeutic combination by assessing overall response rate (ORR) and clinical benefit rate (CBR) after 6 months of treatment, 2) to determine the clinical pharmacology parameters of bosutinib in this regimen, and 3) to build a tissue repository at Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center for further translational study.',\n"," 'Multi compartmental 3D breast cancer disease model-recapitulating tumor complexity in in-vitro.Breast cancer is the most common ailment among women. In 2020, it had the highest incidence of any type of cancer. Many Phase II and III anti-cancer drugs fail due to efficacy, durability, and side effects. Thus, accelerated drug screening models must be accurate. In-vivo models have been used for a long time, but delays, inconsistent results, and a greater sense of responsibility among scientists toward wildlife have led to the search for in-vitro alternatives. Stromal components support breast cancer growth and survival. Multi-compartment Transwell models may be handy instruments. Co-culturing breast cancer cells with endothelium and fibroblasts improves modelling. The extracellular matrix (ECM) supports native 3D hydrogels in natural and polymeric forms. 3D Transwell cultured tumor spheroids mimicked in-vivo pathological conditions. Tumor invasion, migration, Trans-endothelial migration, angiogenesis, and spread are studied using comprehensive models. Transwell models can create a cancer niche and conduct high-throughput drug screening, promising future applications. Our comprehensive shows how 3D in-vitro multi compartmental models may be useful in producing breast cancer stroma in Transwell culture.',\n"," 'Synthesis of structurally diverse derivatives of aconitine-type diterpenoid alkaloids and their anti-proliferative effects on canine breast cancer cells.As one of the most common malignancies in female dogs, no drugs have been developed specifically for the treatment of canine mammary carcinoma. In our previous study, a series of diterpenoid alkaloids derivatives were synthesized and exhibited good anti-proliferative activity in vitro against both normal and adriamycin-resistant human breast cancer cells lines. In this study, a series of structurally diverse aconitine-type alkaloids derivatives were also synthesized basing on the minimal modification principle, by modifying on A-ring, C-ring, D-ring, N-atom or salt formation on aconitine skeleton. Their anti-proliferative effects and mechanism on canine mammary cancer cells were investigated, exhibiting the importance of the substitution at A ring, the long chain ester at the C8, the hydroxyl group at the C13, the phenyl ring at the C14 and the N-ethyl group, while the methoxy group at the C1 and C16 showed little effect on the activity. The results of the proliferation, apoptosis and ultrastructure tests of the treated canine mammary carcinoma cells referred that the representative compound, aconitine linoleate (25) could block the cell cycle of canine mammary carcinoma cells in the G0/G1 phase, and exhibit the anti-proliferative effect by inducing apoptosis.',\n"," 'Exosomal delivery of 7SK long non-coding RNA suppresses viability, proliferation, aggressiveness and tumorigenicity in triple negative breast cancer cells.AIMS: RN7SK (7SK), a highly conserved non-coding RNA, serves as a transcription regulator via interaction with a few proteins. Despite increasing evidences which support the cancer-promoting roles of 7SK-interacting proteins, limited reports address the direct link between 7SK and cancer. To test the hypothetic suppression of cancer by overexpression of 7SK, the effects of exosomal 7SK delivery on cancer phenotypes were studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Exosomes derived from human mesenchymal stem cells were loaded with 7SK (Exo-7SK). MDA-MB-231, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), cell line was treated with Exo-7sk. Expression levels of 7SK were evaluated by qPCR. Cell viability was assessed via MTT and Annexin V/PI assays as well as qPCR assessment of apoptosis-regulating genes. Cell proliferation was evaluated by growth curve analysis, colony formation and cell cycle assays. Aggressiveness of TNBCs was evaluated via transwell migration and invasion assays and qPCR assessment of genes regulating epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Moreover, tumor formation ability was assessed using a nude mice xenograft model. KEY FINDINGS: Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with Exo-7SK resulted in efficient overexpression of 7SK; reduced viability; altered transcription levels of apoptosis-regulating genes; reduced proliferation; reduced migration and invasion; altered transcription of EMT-regulating genes; and reduced in vivo tumor formation ability. Finally, Exo-7SK reduced mRNA levels of HMGA1, a 7SK interacting protein with master gene regulatory and cancer promoting roles, and its bioinformatically-selected cancer promoting target genes. SIGNIFICANCE: Altogether, as a proof of the concept, our findings suggest that exosomal delivery of 7SK may suppress cancer phenotypes via downregulation of HMGA1.',\n"," 'Glycyrrhetinic acid suppresses breast cancer metastasis by inhibiting M2-like macrophage polarization via activating JNK1/2 signaling.BACKGROUND: Breast cancer metastasis is leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have been considered as potential targets for treating breast cancer metastasis because they promote tumor growth and development. Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) is one of the most important phytochemicals of licorice which has shown promising anti-cancer efficacies in pre-clinical trials. However, the regulatory effect of GA on the polarization of TAMs remains elusive. PURPOSE: To investigate the role of GA in regulating the polarization of M2 macrophages and inhibiting breast cancer metastasis, and to further explore its underlying mechanisms of action. STUDY DESIGN: IL-4 / IL-13-treated RAW 264.7 and THP-1 cells were used as the M2-polarized macrophages in vitro. A 4T1 mouse breast cancer model and the tail vein breast cancer metastasis model were applied to study the effect of GA on breast cancer growth and metastasis in vivo. RESULTS: In vitro studies showed that GA significantly inhibited IL-4 / IL 13-induced M2-like polarization in RAW 264.7 and THP-1 macrophages without affecting M1-like polarization. GA strongly decreased the expression of M2 macrophage markers CD206 and Arg-1, and reduced the levels of the pro-angiogenic molecules VEGF, MMP9, MMP2 and IL-10 in M2 macrophages. GA also increased the phosphorylation of JNK1/2 in M2 macrophages. Moreover, GA significantly suppressed M2 macrophage-induced cell proliferation and migration in 4T1 cancer cells and HUVECs. Interestingly, the inhibitory effects of GA on M2 macrophages were abolished by a JNK inhibitor. Animal studies showed that GA significantly suppressed tumor growth, angiogenesis, and lung metastasis in BALB/c mice bearing breast tumor. In tumor tissues, GA reduced the number of M2 macrophages but elevated the proportion of M1 macrophages, accompanied by activation of JNK signaling. Similar results were found in the tail vein breast cancer metastasis model. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated for the first time that GA could effectively suppress breast cancer growth and metastasis by inhibiting macrophage M2 polarization via activating JNK1/2 signaling. These findings indicate that GA could be served as the lead compound for the future development of anti-breast cancer drug.',\n"," 'Isorhamnetin induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by triggering DNA damage and regulating the AMPK/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway in doxorubicin-resistant breast cancer.BACKGROUND: Acquired resistance to doxorubicin (DOX) inevitably limits its clinical use against breast cancer (BC). Isorhamnetin (IS), a native flavonoid which extensively available in vegetables, fruits, and phytomedicine, has been deemed to the probable cancer chemopreventive agent in preceding explorations since it exhibits satisfied antitumor activity. So far, the strategy for alleviating DOX resistance by using IS as a sensitizer against resistant BC has not yet been covered. PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of IS on potentiating the chemoreceptivity of drug-resistant BC cells to DOX in vitro and in vivo and elucidate the possible molecular mechanisms. METHODS: MTS assays, colony formation assays, three-dimensional (3D) tumor spheroid model, and migration assay were deployed to verify the inhibiting action of IS in the presence or absence of DOX on resistant BC cells in vitro. Apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and endocellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined by flow cytometry. Protein levels were monitored by western blotting. Nuclear staining and EdU proliferation were photographed with a confocal laser scanning microscope. The effects of the IS and DOX combination on the tumorigenesis in the xenograft experiments were evaluated for further confirming the in vitro cytotoxicity. RESULTS: IS significantly inhibited cell proliferation and migration and enhanced the antitumor competence of DOX against resistant BC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Adjuvant IS (50\\xa0μM) effectively enhanced the proapoptotic impacts of DOX in resistant BC cells (35.38\\xa0±\\xa03.18%, vs. 5.83\\xa0±\\xa00.68% in the DOX group) by suppressing the expression of bcl 2 in addition to enhancing cleaved caspase 3, ultimately leading to DNA condensation and fragmentation. IS (20, 30, and 50\\xa0μM) treatments induced significant increases in the G2/M populations (41.60\\xa0±\\xa01.28%, 44.60\\xa0±\\xa01.14%, and 50.64\\xa0±\\xa00.67%, vs. 35.84\\xa0±\\xa01.56% in the untreated control in MCF7/ADR cells, p < 0.01) via regulating CDK1/Cyclin B1 complex expression, subsequently triggering the inhibition of BC proliferation. In addition, IS (10, 20, 30, and 50\\xa0μM) stimulated the production of interstitial ROS in MCF7/ADR cells, by 3.99-, 4.20-, 6.29-, and 6.78-fold, respectively, versus the untreated group (p < 0.001), which were involved in DNA damage and AMPK-caused intercept of the mTOR/p70S6K signaling. CONCLUSION: Our study suggested the anti-breast cancer actions of IS as a DOX sensitizer and expounded the underlying molecular mechanisms, showing that IS could be deemed to a capable alternative for resistant BC cure.',\n"," 'DNA-binding affinity and molecular docking studies of the PEGylated binuclear palladacycle, BTC2, an efficient metallodrug against triple-negative breast cancer.Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has a low five-year survival rate, especially if the cancer is diagnosed at a late stage and has already metastasized beyond the breast tissue. Current chemotherapeutic options for TNBC rely on traditional platinum-containing drugs like cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin. Unfortunately, these drugs are indiscriminately toxic, resulting in severe side effects and the development of drug resistance. Palladium compounds have shown to be viable alternatives to platinum complexes since they are less toxic and have displayed selectivity towards the TNBC cell lines. Here we report the design, synthesis, and characterization of a series of binuclear benzylidene palladacycles with varying phosphine bridging ligands. From this series we have identified BTC2 to be more soluble (28.38-56.77\\xa0μg/mL) and less toxic than its predecessor, AJ5, while maintaining its anticancer properties (IC(50) (MDA-MB-231)\\xa0=\\xa00.58\\xa0±\\xa00.012\\xa0μM). To complement the previous cell death pathway study of BTC2, we investigated the DNA and BSA binding properties of BTC2 through various spectroscopic and electrophoretic techniques, as well as molecular docking studies. We demonstrate that BTC2 displays multimodal DNA binding properties as both a partial intercalator and groove binder, with the latter being the predominant mode of action. BTC2 was also able to quench the fluorescence of BSA, thereby suggesting that the compound could be transported by albumin in mammalian cells. Molecular docking studies revealed that BTC2 is a major groove binder and binds preferentially to subdomain IIB of BSA. This study provides insight into the influence of the ligands on the activity of the binuclear palladacycles and provides much needed information on the mechanisms through which these complexes elicit their potent anticancer activity.',\n"," 'A review of quantitative diffusion-weighted MR imaging for breast cancer: Towards noninvasive biomarker.Quantitative diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is an important adjunct to conventional breast MRI and shows promise as a noninvasive biomarker of breast cancer in multiple clinical scenarios, from the discrimination of benign and malignant lesions, prediction, and evaluation of treatment response to a prognostic assessment of breast cancer. Various quantitative parameters are derived from different DWI models based on special prior knowledge and assumptions, have different meanings, and are easy to confuse. In this review, we describe the quantitative parameters derived from conventional and advanced DWI models commonly used in breast cancer and summarize the promising clinical applications of these quantitative parameters. Although promising, it is still challenging for these quantitative parameters to become clinically useful noninvasive biomarkers in breast cancer, as multiple factors may result in variations in quantitative parameter measurements. Finally, we briefly describe some considerations regarding the factors that cause variations.',\n"," \"Anaesthesia and cancer recurrence: the influence of perioperative anaesthetic technique on cancer recurrence after surgery.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, and incidence is increasing. Excisional surgery is essential in approximately 70% of solid organ tumours. Emerging research in onco-anaesthesiology suggests that perioperative anaesthetic and analgesic techniques might influence long-term oncologic outcomes. RECENT FINDINGS: Prospective, randomized control trials (RCTs) demonstrate that perioperative regional and neuraxial anaesthetic techniques do not affect cancer recurrence. Ongoing trials are investigating the potential outcome benefits of systemic lidocaine. Retrospective studies indicate improved postoperative oncologic outcomes for certain types of breast cancer with higher intraoperative opioid dosage, nuancing available evidence on the effect of opioids. RCT evidence suggests that propofol has no beneficial effect compared with volatiles on breast cancer recurrence, although it remains unclear whether this applies to other cancer types. SUMMARY: Although regional anaesthesia definitively does not affect cancer recurrence, ongoing prospective RCTs with oncological outcomes as primary endpoints are awaited to establish if other anaesthetic or analgesic techniques influence cancer recurrence. Until such trials conclusively identify a causal relationship, insufficient evidence exists to recommend specific anaesthetic or analgesic techniques for tumour resection surgery based on altering the patient's risk of recurrence.\",\n"," 'Development of certain aminoquinazoline scaffolds as potential multitarget anticancer agents with apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects: Design, synthesis and biological evaluation.Newly designed 4 11a, b, 12a, b and 13a, b) have been synthesized and evaluated for their potential multitarget anticancer activities, apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects. Thereupon, in vitro cytotoxic activities of all the synthesized compounds were screened against NCI 60 human cancer cell lines (nine subpanels) at NCI, USA. Successfully, 2-morpholino-N-(quinazolin-4-yl) acetohydrazide 5e was granted an NSC code, owing to its significant potency and broad spectrum of activity against various cancer cell lines; leukemia K-562, non-small cell lung cancer NCI-H522 cells, colon cancer SW-620, melanoma LOX IMVI, MALME-3M, renal cancer RXF 393, ACHN and breast cancer MDA-MB231/ATCC (GI% = 99.6, 161, 126.03, 90.22, 174.47, 139.7, 191 and 97, respectively). Compound 5e showed the best inhibitory activity (GI(50)\\xa0=\\xa01.3\\xa0µM) against melanoma LOX IMVI, when tested at five doses against NCI 60 cell lines. Furthermore, compound 5e showed comparable EGFR and CDK2 inhibitory activity results (IC(50)\\xa0=\\xa00.093\\xa0±\\xa00.006\\xa0μM and 0.143\\xa0±\\xa00.008\\xa0μM, respectively) to those of lapatinib and ribociclib (IC(50)\\xa0=\\xa00.03\\xa0±\\xa00.002\\xa0μM and 0.067\\xa0±\\xa00.004\\xa0μM, respectively). Western blotting analysis of compound 5e against melanoma LOX IMVI marked out significant reduced EGFR and CDK2 protein expression percentages, up to 32.97% and 34.09%, respectively, if compared to lapatinib (31.18%) and ribociclib (29.66%). Moreover, compound 5e caused clear cell cycle arrests at S phase of renal UO-31 cells and at G1 phase of both breast cancer MCF7 and ovarian cancer IGROV1, associated with remarkable increase of DNA content of the controls. In accordance, it demonstrated promising anti- proliferative and apoptotic activities, showing a significant increase in total apoptotic percentages of renal cancer UO-31, breast cancer MCF7 and ovarian IGROV1 cancer cell lines, if compared to the control untreated cells (from 1.79% to 46.72%, 2.19% to 39.02% and 1.66 to 42.51%, respectively). Molecular modelling and dynamic simulation study results supported the main objectives of the present work.',\n"," 'Oxidative stress mediates the associations between phthalate exposures and thyroid cancer/benign nodule risk.Epidemiological studies have suggested that phthalate exposures are associated with increased risks of thyroid cancer and benign nodule, while the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we explored the mediation effects of oxidative stress (OS) biomarkers in the associations between phthalate exposures and the risks of thyroid cancer and benign nodule. Urine samples collected from 143 thyroid cancer, 136 nodule patients, and 141 healthy controls were analyzed for 8 phthalate metabolites and 3 OS biomarkers [8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal-mercapturic acid (HNE-MA), and 8-iso-prostaglandin F(2α) (8-isoPGF(2α))]. Multivariable linear or logistic regression models were used to explore the associations of OS biomarkers with phthalate metabolite concentrations and the risks of thyroid cancer and nodule. The mediation role of OS biomarkers was also investigated. Urinary monoethyl phthalate (MEP), monomethyl phthalate (MMP), mono (2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), mono (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), and mono (2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP) were positively associated with at least 2 OS biomarkers (all P-values<0.01), and part of these positive associations varied in different subgroups. All 3 OS biomarkers were positively associated with the risks of thyroid nodule and cancer (P-values<0.001). The mediation analysis showed that OS biomarkers significantly mediated the associations between urinary MEHOP concentration and nodule, as well as between urinary MMP, MEHP, and MEHHP concentrations and cancer and nodule, with the estimated proportions of mediation ranging from 15.8% to 85.6%. Our results suggest that OS is a potential mediating mechanism through which phthalate exposures induce thyroid carcinogenesis and nodular formation.',\n"," 'Interaction of neutral and protonated Tamoxifen with the DPPC lipid bilayer using molecular dynamics simulation.Tamoxifen as an antiestrogen is successfully applied for the clinical treatment of breast cancer in pre- and post-menopausal women. Due to the side effects related to the oral administration of Tamoxifen (such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, hot flushes, ocular disturbances and some types of cancer), liposomal drug delivery is recommended for taking this drug. Drug encapsulation in a liposomal or lipid drug delivery system improves the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. In this regard, we carried out 200-ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for three systems (pure DPPC and neutral and protonated Tamoxifen-loaded DPPC). Here, DPPC is a model lipid bilayer to provide us with conditions like liposomal drug delivery systems to investigate the interactions between Tamoxifen and DPPC lipid bilayers and to estimate the preferred location and orientation of the drug molecule inside the bilayer membrane. Properties such as area per lipid, membrane thickness, lateral diffusion coefficient, order parameters and mass density, were surveyed. With insertion of neutral and protonated Tamoxifen inside the DPPC lipid bilayers, area per lipid and membrane thickness increased slightly. Also, Tamoxifen induce ordering of the hydrocarbon chains in DPPC bilayer. Analysis of MD trajectories shows that neutral Tamoxifen is predominantly found in the hydrophobic tail region, whereas protonated Tamoxifen is located at the lipid-water interface (polar region of DPPC lipid bilayers).',\n"," 'Oxypalmatine regulates proliferation and apoptosis of breast cancer cells by inhibiting PI3K/AKT signaling and its efficacy against breast cancer organoids.BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) is known as the most common cancer in women. Discovering novel and effective drugs is a priority for the treatment of BC. Oxypalmatine (OPT) is a natural protoberberine-type alkaloid isolated from Phellodendron amurense Rupr. (Rutaceae) with potential anti-cancer activity. PURPOSE: This investigation aimed to elucidate the biological role and potential mechanisms of OPT in BC cells, and intended to assess the therapeutic potential of OPT in BC patient-derived organoid models. METHODS: CCK-8 and EdU assays, and flow cytometry were used to test the activity of OPT against BC cells. In addition, patient-derived organoid models were constructed to assess the therapeutic efficiency of OPT in BC. Besides, network pharmacological analysis and RNA sequencing analysis were performed to predict the underlying anti-BC mechanism of OPT. Moreover, Western blot analysis was applied to test the expression of genes modulated by OPT. RESULTS: OPT attenuated the proliferation and DNA replication, and induced apoptosis in multiple BC cells. Interestingly, OPT also exerted a cytotoxic effect on BC organoids characterized as luminal A, HER2-overexpressing, and triple-negative subtypes, indicating that OPT was a potential broad-spectrum anticancer drug. Network pharmacological analysis suggested that OPT might affect signals contributing to BC progression, including PI3K/AKT, MAPK, and VEGFA-VEGFR2 signaling pathways. Moreover, bioinformatics analysis of data from our RNA sequencing suggested that PI3K/AKT was a downstream pathway of OPT in BC. Finally, OPT was shown to inactivate PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in BC cells by Western blot analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our study demonstrated that OPT suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis through mitigating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in BC cells. Moreover, our work first adopted BC organoid models to confirm OPT as an effective and promising drug, laying a foundation for the potential use of OPT in BC treatment.',\n"," 'β,\\xa0β-Dimethylacrylshikonin potentiates paclitaxel activity, suppresses immune evasion and triple negative breast cancer progression via STAT3Y705 phosphorylation inhibition based on network pharmacology and transcriptomics analysis.BACKGOUND: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an extremely aggressive and rapidly progressing cancer, wherein existing therapies provide little benefit to patients. β, β-Dimethylacrylshikonin (DMAS), an active naphthoquinone derived from comfrey root, has potent anticancer activity. However, the antitumor function of DMAS against TNBC remains to be proved. PURPOSE: Explore effects of DMAS on TNBC and clarify the mechanism. STUDY DESIGN: Network pharmacology, transcriptomics and various cell functional experiments were applied to TNBC cells to explore the effects of DMAS on TNBC. The conclusions were further validated in xenograft animal models. METHODS: MTT, EdU, transwell, scratch tests, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and immunoblot were utilized to assess the activity of DMAS on three TNBC cell lines. The anti-TNBC mechanism of DMAS was clarified by overexpression and knockdown of STAT3 in BT-549 cells. In vivo efficacy of DMAS was analysed using a xenograft mouse model. RESULTS: In vitro analysis revealed that DMAS inhibited the G2/M phase transition and suppressed TNBC proliferation. Additionally, DMAS triggered mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis and reduced cell migration by antagonizing epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Mechanistically, DMAS exerted its antitumour effects by inhibiting STAT3Y705 phosphorylation. STAT3 overexpression abolished the inhibitory effect of DMAS. Further studies showed that treatment with DMAS inhibited TNBC growth in a xenograft model. Notably, DMAS potentiated the sensitivity of TNBC to paclitaxel and inhibited immune evasion by downregulating the immune checkpoint PD-L1. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, our study revealed that DMAS potentiates paclitaxel activity, suppresses immune evasion and TNBC progression by inhibiting STAT3 pathway. It has the potential as a promising agent for TNBC.',\n"," \"A colorimetric and photothermal dual-mode biosensing platform based on nanozyme-functionalized flower-like DNA structures for tumor-derived exosome detection.Tumor-derived exosomes can be served as a kind of promising biomarkers for early diagnosis of cancers. Herein, a colorimetric/photothermal dual-mode exosomes sensing platform is developed for human breast cancer cell (MCF-7)-derived exosomes based on encapsulation of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine-loaded graphene quantum dot nanozymes (TMB-GQDzymes) into DNA flowers (DFs) via rolling circle amplification (RCA). To achieve specific detection, EpCAM aptamer for MCF-7 cell-derived exosomes is immobilized on the well plate, while the complementary sequence of another CD63 aptamer is designed into the circular template to obtain abundant capture probes. Benefitting from the dual-aptamer recognition strategy, a sandwich structure of EpCAM aptamer/exosomes/TMB-GQDzymes@DFs is formed, in which the GQDzymes can catalyze the oxidation of TMB in the presence of H(2)O(2). The resulting products of TMB oxidation (oxTMB) can induce not only the absorption changes but also a near-infrared (NIR) laser-driven photothermal effect, achieving dual-mode detection of exosomes with the limit of detection (LOD) of 1027 particles/μL (colorimetry) and 2170 particles/μL (photothermal detection), respectively. In addition, this sensing platform has demonstrated excellent performance to well distinguish breast cancer patients from healthy individuals in serum samples analysis. Overall, the proposed dual-readout biosensor opens promising prospects for exosome detection in biological study and clinical applications.\",\n"," 'Simultaneous quantification of multiple single nucleotide variants in PIK3CA ctDNA using mass-tagged LCR probe sets.Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in blood carries genetic variations associated with tumors. There is evidence indicating that the abundance of single nucleotide variant (SNV) in ctDNA is correlated well with cancer progression and metastasis. Thus, accurate and quantitative detection of SNVs in ctDNA may benefit clinical practice. However, most current methods are unsuitable for the quantification of SNV in ctDNA that usually differentiates from wild-type DNA (wtDNA) only by a single base. In this setting, ligase chain reaction (LCR) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) was developed to simultaneously quantify multiple SNVs using PIK3CA ctDNA as a model. Mass-tagged LCR probe set for each SNV including mass-tagged probe and three DNA probes was firstly designed and prepared. Then, LCR was initiated to discriminate SNVs specifically and amplify the signal of SNVs in ctDNA selectively. Afterward, a biotin-streptavidin reaction system was used to separate the amplified products, and photolysis was initiated to release mass tags. Finally, mass tags were monitored and quantified by MS. After optimizing conditions and verifying performance, this quantitative system was applied for blood samples from breast cancer patients, and risk stratification for breast cancer metastasis was also performed. This study is among the first to quantify multiple SNVs in ctDNA in a signal amplification and conversion manner, and also highlights the potential of SNV in ctDNA as a liquid biopsy marker to monitor cancer progression and metastasis.',\n"," \"Mediators of county-level racial and economic privilege in cancer screening.BACKGROUND: Area-level social determinants of health (SDoH) impact access to cancer care and prevention. Little is known about the factors that underlie the impact of residential privilege on county-level cancer screening uptake. METHODS: Population-based cross-sectional study examining county-level data was obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's PLACES database, American Community Survey and the County Health Rankings and Roadmap database. The Index of Concentration of Extremes (ICE), a validated measure of racial and economic privilege, was examined relative to county-level rates of US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guideline-concordant screening for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers. Generalized structural equation modeling was used to determine the indirect and direct effects of ICE on cancer screening uptake. RESULTS: Across 3142 counties, county-level cancer screening rates demonstrated geographical variation ranging from 54.0% to 81.8% for breast cancer screening, from 39.8% to 74.4% for colorectal cancer screening, and from 69.9% to 89.7% for cervical cancer screening. Of note, cancer screening rates for breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer all increased from lower (ICE-Q1) to higher (ICE-Q4) privileged areas (breast: Q1\\u2009=\\u200971.0% vs. Q4\\u2009=\\u200972.2%; colorectal: Q1\\u2009=\\u200959.4% vs. Q4\\u2009=\\u200965.0%; cervical: Q1\\u2009=\\u200983.3% vs. Q4\\u2009=\\u200985.2%; all p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Mediation analysis revealed that the observed disparities between ICE and cancer screening uptake were explained by mediators such as poverty status, lack of health insurance or employment, urban-rural location and access to primary care physicians that accounted for 64% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 61%-67%), 85% (95% CI: 80%-89%), and 74% (95% CI: 71%-77%) of the effect on breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer screening, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In this cross-sectional study, the association between racial and economic privilege on USPSTF-recommended cancer screening was complex and influenced by an interplay of sociodemographic, geographical, and structural factors. Understanding the underlying area-level SDoH that mediate disparities in cancer prevention strategies can help focus interventions to improve equity in cancer prevention.\",\n"," 'Increasing rates of general anesthesia use in lumpectomy procedures: A 15-year trends analysis.BACKGROUND: Anesthesia methods in oncologic breast surgery have evolved with less invasive practices. The aims of this study were primarily to examine trends in anesthesia type used during lumpectomy. METHODS: We analyzed lumpectomy procedures from 2005 to 2019 using the NSQIP database. Upon defining the nadir in general anesthesia (GA) and peak in monitored anesthesia care (MAC) use as 2007, we compared patient characteristics and complications in the 2007 versus 2019 GA and MAC cohorts. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine associations with receipt of GA. RESULTS: Of 253\\u2009545 lumpectomy patients, 191\\u2009773 (75.6%) received GA and 61\\u2009772 (24.4%) received MAC. From 2005 to 2019, GA rates increased from 66.7% to 82.5%, while MAC rates decreased from 33.3% to 17.5%. More GA patients were obese and American Society of Anesthesiologists\\xa0class 3. Over time, age and body mass index\\xa0(BMI) increased in both GA and MAC cohorts. Odds of receiving GA increased over time, and predictors included concurrent axillary lymph node dissection (p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) or sentinel lymph node biopsy (p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate increasing use of GA over time for lumpectomy, which may be related to aging lumpectomy patient population with higher BMIs. We also find a strong association between use of GA and concurrent lymph node procedures.',\n"," 'A new practical method of estimating tumoral microenvironment parameters of possible prognostic significance in patients with invasive breast carcinoma: Combined microenvironment score.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In recent years, the tumor microenvironment has become increasingly recognized as an influential factor in breast cancer development and growth. The parameters that form the microenvironment are the tumor stroma ratio and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. In addition, tumor budding, which shows the ability of the tumor to metastasize, gives information about the progression of the tumor. In this study, the combined microenvironment score (CMS) was determined with these parameters, and the relationship between CMS and prognostic parameters and survival was evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In our study, tumor stroma ratio, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and tumor budding were evaluated in hematoxylin-eosin sections of 419 patients with invasive ductal carcinoma. Patients were scored separately for each of these parameters, and these scores were summed to determine the CMS. The patients were divided into 3 groups according to CMS and the relationship between CMS and prognostic parameters and the survival of the patients was studied. RESULTS: The patients with CMS 3 had higher histological grade and Ki67 proliferation index compared to CMS 1 and 2. Additionally, lymphovascular invasion, axillary lymph node and distant metastasis were more common. Disease-free, and overall survival were significantly shortened in the CMS 3 group. CMS was found as an independent risk factor for DFS (HR: 2.144 (95\\xa0% CI: 1.219-3.77) p: 0.008), but not an independent risk factor for OS. CONCLUSION: CMS is a prognostic parameter that can be easily evaluated and does not require extra time and cost. Evaluating the morphological parameters of the microenvironment with a single scoring system will contribute to routine pathology practice and predict patient prognosis.',\n"," 'Are the MIA and MSKCC nomograms useful in selecting patients with melanoma for sentinel lymph node biopsy?BACKGROUND AND METHODS: The Melanoma Institute of Australia (MIA) and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) nomograms were developed to help guide sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) decisions. Although statistically validated, whether these prediction models provide clinical benefit at National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline-endorsed thresholds is unknown. We conducted a net benefit analysis to quantify the clinical utility of these nomograms at risk thresholds of 5%-10% compared to the alternative strategy of biopsying all patients. External validation data for MIA and MSKCC nomograms were extracted from respective published studies. RESULTS: The MIA nomogram provided added net benefit at a risk threshold of 9% but net harm at 5%-8% and 10%. The MSKCC nomogram provided added net benefit at risk thresholds of 5% and 9%-10% but net harm at 6%-8%. When present, the magnitude of net benefit was small (1-3 net avoidable biopsies per 100 patients). CONCLUSION: Neither model consistently provided added net benefit compared to performing SLNB for all patients. DISCUSSION: Based on published data, use of the MIA or MSKCC nomograms as decision-making tools for SLNB at risk thresholds of 5%-10% does not clearly provide clinical benefit to patients.',\n"," '\"Time\" for obesity-related cancer: The role of the circadian rhythm in cancer pathogenesis and treatment.The circadian rhythm is regulated by an intrinsic time-tracking system, composed both of a central and a peripheral clock, which influences the cycles of activities and sleep of an individual over 24\\xa0h. At the molecular level, the circadian rhythm begins when two basic helix-loop-helix/Per-ARNT-SIM (bHLH-PAS) proteins, BMAL-1 and CLOCK, interact with each other to produce BMAL-1/CLOCK heterodimers in the cytoplasm. The BMAL-1/CLOCK target genes encode for the repressor components of the clock, cryptochrome (Cry1 and Cry2) and the Period proteins (Per1, Per2 and Per3). It has been recently demonstrated that the disruption of circadian rhythm is associated with an increased risk of developing obesity and obesity-related diseases. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the disruption of the circadian rhythm plays a key role in tumorigenesis. Further, an association between the circadian rhythm disruptions and an increased incidence and progression of several types of cancer (e.g., breast, prostate, colorectal and thyroid cancer) has been found. As the perturbation of circadian rhythm has adverse metabolic consequences (e.g., obesity) and at the same time tumor promoter functions, this manuscript has the aim to report how the aberrant circadian rhythms affect the development and prognosis of different types of obesity-related cancers (breast, prostate, colon rectal and thyroid cancer) focusing on both human studies and on molecular aspects.',\n"," 'In situ synthesis of Cu nanoclusters/CeO(2) nanorod as aggregated induced ECL probe for triple-negative breast cancer detection.Cu nanoclusters (NCs) have attracted a lot of attention due to the excellent properties. However, the low luminescence and poor stability limited the Cu NC-based sensing research. In this work, Cu NCs were in situ synthesized on CeO(2) nanorods. On the one hand, the aggregated induced electrochemiluminescence (AIECL) of Cu NCs has been observed on the CeO(2) nanorods. On the other hand, the substrate of CeO(2) nanorods acted as catalysis, which reduced the excitation potential and further enhanced the ECL signal of Cu NCs. It was noticed that CeO(2) nanorods also greatly improved the stability of Cu NCs. The resulted high ECL signals of Cu NCs can be kept constant for several days. Furthermore, MXene nanosheets/Au NPs has been employed as electrode modification materials to construct the sensing platform to detect miRNA-585-3p in triple negative breast cancer tissues. Au NPs@MXene nanosheets not only enlarged the specific interface area of the electrodes and the number of reaction sites, but also modulated electron transfer to amplify the ECL signal of Cu NCs. The biosensor had a low detection limit (0.9\\xa0fM) and a wide linear range (1\\xa0fM to 1\\xa0μM) for the detection of miRNA-585-3p in the clinic tissues.',\n"," 'The role of exercise in obesity-related cancers: Current evidence and biological mechanisms.Cancer ranks among the five leading causes of death in almost all countries and has important repercussions for individual and public health, the healthcare system, and society in general. Obesity increases the incidence of many types of cancer, but growing evidence suggests that physical activity may decrease risk for developing a variety of obesity-related cancer types, and, in some cases, may improve cancer prognosis and mortality rates. This review summarizes recent evidence on the effect of physical activity on obesity-related cancer prevention and survival. For some cancers, including breast, colorectal, and endometrial cancer, there is strong evidence for a preventative effect of exercise, but for many others, including gallbladder and kidney cancer, and multiple myeloma, evidence is inconsistent or largely lacking. Though many potential mechanisms have been proposed to explain the onco-protective effect of exercise, including improved insulin sensitivity, alterations in sex hormone availability, improved immune function and inflammation, myokine secretion, and modulation of intracellular signaling at the level of AMP kinase, the exact mechanism(s) of action within each cancer subtype remains poorly defined. Overall, a deeper understanding of how exercise can help against cancer and of the exercise parameters that can be altered to optimize exercise prescription is necessary and should be the subject of future investigation.',\n"," 'Narirutin downregulates lipoxygenase-5 expression and induces G0/G1 arrest in triple-negative breast carcinoma cells.BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 20% of breast cancer that does not express HER2, progesterone and estrogen receptors. It is associated with a high mortality rate, morbidity, metastasis, recurrence, poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy. Lipoxygenase-5 (LOX-5), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), cathepsin-D (CATD), ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) are involved in breast cancer carcinogenesis; hence, there is a pressing need to identify novel chemicals that targets these enzymes. Narirutin, a flavanone glycoside abundantly present in citrus fruits, is reported to have immune-modulatory, anti-allergic and antioxidant potential. Still, the cancer chemopreventive mechanism against TNBC has not been explored. METHODS: In vitro experiments, enzyme activity, expression analysis, molecular docking and MD simulation were carried out. RESULTS: Narirutin suppressed the growth of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 in a dose-proportional manner. The pronounced effect with >50% inhibition was observed in SRB and MTT assays for MDAMB-231 cells. Unexpectedly, narirutin suppressed the proliferation of normal cells (24.51%) at 100\\xa0μM. Further, narirutin inhibits the activity of LOX-5 in cell-free (18.18\\xa0±\\xa03.93\\xa0μM) and cell-based (48.13\\xa0±\\xa07.04\\xa0μM) test systems while moderately affecting COX-2, CATD, ODC and DHFR activity. Moreover, narirutin revealed a down-regulation of LOX-5 expression with a fold change of 1.23. Besides, MD simulation experiments confirm that narirutin binding forms a stable complex with LOX-5 and improves the stability and compactness of LOX-5. In addition, the prediction analysis demonstrates that narirutin could not cross the blood-brain barrier and did not act as an inhibitor of different CYPs. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Narirutin could be a potent cancer chemopreventive lead for TNBC, further paving the way for synthesizing novel analogues.',\n"," 'miRNA-1246, HOTAIR, and IL-39 signature as potential diagnostic biomarkers in breast cancer.The molecular alterations in noncoding RNA can lead to a cellular storm that is correlated to higher mortality and morbidity rates and contributes to the progression and metastasis of cancer. Herein, we aim to evaluate the expression levels and correlations of microRNA-1246 (miR-1246), HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR), and interleukin-39 (IL-39) in patients with breast cancer (BC). In this study, 130 participants were recruited, including 90 breast cancer patients and 40 healthy control participants. Serum levels of miR-1246 and HOTAIR expression were assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Also, the level of IL-39 expression was evaluated using a Western blot. All BC participants demonstrated a remarkable elevation in miR-1246 and HOTAIR expression levels. Moreover, IL-39 expression levels demonstrated a noticeable decline in BC patients. Furthermore, the differential expression fold of miR-1246 and HOTAIR revealed a strong positive correlation among breast cancer patients. In addition, a negative relationship between the IL-39 and the miR-1246 and HOTAIR differential expression was also noticed. This study revealed that HOTAIR/miR-1246 exerts an oncogenic impact in patients with breast cancer. The expression levels of circulation miR-1246, HOTAIR, and IL-39 could be considered early diagnostic biomarkers in BC patients.',\n"," 'A high performance dual-mode biosensor based on Nd-MOF nanosheets functionalized with ionic liquid and gold nanoparticles for sensing of ctDNA.A dual-mode biosensor constructed based on photoelectrochemical (PEC) and electrochemical (EC) property was developed for assaying circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), which is commonly used for triple-negative breast cancer diagnosis. Ionic liquid functionalized two-dimensional Nd-MOF nanosheets were successfully synthesized through a template-assisted reagent substituting reaction. Nd-MOF nanosheets integrated with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were able to improve photocurrent response and supply active sites for assembling sensing elements. To achieve selective detection of ctDNA, thiol-functionalized capture probes (CPs) were immobilized on the Nd-MOF@AuNPs modified glassy carbon electrode surface, thereby generating a \"signal-off\" photoelectrochemical biosensor for ctDNA under visible light irradiation. After the recognition of ctDNA, ferrocene-labeled signaling probes (Fc-SPs) were introduced into the biosensing interface. After hybridization between ctDNA and Fc-SPs, the oxidation peak current of Fc-SPs generated from square wave voltammetry can be employed as a \"signal-on\" electrochemical signal for ctDNA quantification. Under the optimized conditions, a linear relationship was obtained to the logarithm of ctDNA concentration in between 1.0\\xa0fmol\\xa0L(-1) to 10\\xa0nmol\\xa0L(-1) for the PEC model and 1.0\\xa0fmol\\xa0L(-1) to 1.0\\xa0nmol\\xa0L(-1) for the EC model. The dual-mode biosensor can provide accurate results for ctDNA assays, effectively eliminating the probable occurrence of false-positive or false-negative results in single-model assays. By switching DNA probe sequences, the proposed dual-mode biosensing platform can serve as a strategy for detecting other DNAs and possesses broad applications in bioassay and early disease diagnosis.',\n"," \"Breast Cancer in Two Ex-Votos, A Millennia Apart: Patients' Hope and Faith Expressed Through the Centuries in Votive Offerings.A\\xa0votive offering or ex-voto includes a variety of usually non-professional artworks offered to divinities and placed in religious sites to fulfill a vow or in gratitude for recovery from an illness or injury. Unfortunately, the ancient period lacks a scientifically verifiable understanding of the true nature of cancer and its natural history and, consequently, a lack of effective treatment. This paper discusses two ex-votos potentially related to breast cancer distant more than 2000\\xa0years, one from the other. The ex-votos convey the complex relationship of humans with illness through an art expression stemming from the heart and minds of ordinary people.\",\n"," 'Computational study of novel natural inhibitors targeting Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog G12C.Lung adenocarcinoma is one of the most aggressive and rapidly fatal types of malignant lung tumor. Molecular docking and virtual screening were effectively and systematically used to identify specific targets in malignant tumors and screen potential drugs. Here, we screen perfect leading compounds from a medicate library (ZINC15 database) and analyze their properties (conveyance, absorption, metabolism, excretion, and harmless forecasts) with potential inhibition of Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog (KRAS) G12C. Further results demonstrated that ZINC000013817014 and ZINC000004098458 were screened out from the ZINC15 database and were identified to have a much better binding affinity and more favorable interaction vitality binding with KRAS G12C and less rat carcinogenicity, Ames mutagenicity, way better dissolvability in water and noninhibition with cytochrome P-450 2D6. Molecular dynamics simulation analysis indicated that the binding capacity of these two compounds and KRAS G12C, ZINC000013817014-KRAS G12C, and ZINC000004098458-KRAS G12C is stable in the natural environment. Our findings reveal that ZINC000013817014 and ZINC000004098458 were perfect leading compounds to be inhibitors binding with KRAS G12C, which were selected as safe drug candidates and a cornerstone for KRAS G12C-related medicine plan and improvement. What is more, we have conducted a Cell Counting Kit-8 to verify the exactly inhibitory effects of the two selected drugs on Lung adenocarcinoma. This study establishes a solid framework for systematic anticancer medication research and development.',\n"," 'Pathological complete response and prognosis after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with HER2-low breast cancer.BACKGROUND: The development of novel human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) antibody drug conjugates brings encouraging opportunities for the treatment of HER2-low breast cancer. In this study, we investigated the clinical factors and prognosis of HER2-low breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). METHODS: Data from patients diagnosed with HER2-zero or HER2-low breast cancer at a single center between January 2017 and December 2021 who underwent NAC followed by surgery were retrospectively reviewed. HER2 status was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH), and classified as HER2-zero (IHC 0), HER2-low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+ and FISH-), and HER2-positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+ and FISH+). Baseline characteristics were analyzed and compared between the HER2-low and HER2-zero groups. Survival outcomes were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test and Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis. RESULTS: The sample comprised 132 patients with HER2-zero [n\\xa0=\\xa062 (47.0\\xa0%)] and HER2-low [n\\xa0=\\xa070 (53.0\\xa0%)] breast cancer. Relative to the HER2-zero group, the HER2-low group contained larger proportions of patients with hormone receptor (HR) positivity (37.1\\xa0% vs. 75.7\\xa0%, P\\xa0<\\xa00.001) and low nuclear grades and Ki-67 indices (both P\\xa0<\\xa00.05). The pathological complete response (pCR) rate was significantly lower in the HER2-low group than in the HER2-zero group (20.0\\xa0% vs. 37.1\\xa0%, P\\xa0=\\xa00.03). At the final follow-up [median 20 (range 4-66) months], patients with HER2-low status had significantly favorable disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) outcomes relative to those with HER2-zero status (87.1\\xa0% vs. 71.0\\xa0%, P\\xa0=\\xa00.02 and 94.3\\xa0% vs. 82.3\\xa0%, P\\xa0=\\xa00.02, respectively). HER2-low status and pCR were independent prognostic factors for DFS [hazard ratio (HR)\\xa0=\\xa00.31, 95\\xa0% confidence interval (CI) 0.13-0.75, P\\xa0=\\xa00.009 and HR\\xa0=\\xa00.08, 95\\xa0% CI 0.01-0.67, P\\xa0=\\xa00.02, respectively]. CONCLUSION: This analysis revealed that HER2-low status is associated significantly with HR positivity and low nuclear grades, Ki-67 indices, and pCR rate. It is also associated with favorable DFS and OS outcomes after NAC. HER2-low status and pCR are independent prognostic factors for DFS.',\n"," 'Urothelial carcinoma metastases impacting the CNS: A 20-year retrospective series.INTRODUCTION: Our group has a longstanding interest in metastases impacting the central nervous system (CNS), including spread from prostatic adenocarcinomas, thyroid carcinomas, and breast carcinomas, most of which metastasize to CNS sites at a later time after the primary tumor is well-known. However, one of the least frequent types of systemic malignancies to metastasize to brain or spine is urothelial carcinoma. Thus, few large studies from a single institution exist. Fewer still detail the interval between first diagnosis of primary tumor and CNS lesion, or whether a patient might have their first presentation of cancer in the brain or spine, thus prompting review of our 20-year experience. MATERIALS: Case identification via text word search of pathology databases from our adult and referral hospitals, 2002 to present. Demographic and clinical data were extracted from reports and the medical record. RESULTS: 15 cases, 11 male: 4 female, age range 37-82\\xa0years were identified. Nine had metastases to brain parenchyma, 5 to vertebral column impacting spinal cord, and 2 to skull, one of which had tumor extension into right parietal lobe. Strikingly, 5 of 15 patients had had their CNS-impacting metastasis as their first presentation of neoplastic disease. CONCLUSIONS: CNS metastasis of urothelial carcinoma is a rare occurrence; nevertheless, pathologists should include urothelial carcinoma in their differential diagnosis as a type of cancer that can first present with a CNS-impacting metastasis.',\n"," 'Outcomes of single brain metastasis treated with gamma knife stereotaxic radiosurgery(GKSR). Our experience on 103 cases.BACKGROUND: Brain metastases (BM) occur in the natural course of malignant tumors in 18-40% of cases. Their management has changed considerably over the past decade thanks to the advent of Gamma knife Stereotactic Radiosurgery (GKSR). OBJECTIVE: We report our experience on Single Brain metastasis treated with (GKSR). METHODS: Patients treated by Gamma Knife stereotaxic radiosurgery (GKSR) in our institution between 2009 and 2021 for Single BM were recorded retrospectively. RESULTS: A total of 103 patients (n\\xa0=\\xa052; 50.5% females) were included, with a mean age of 56.33\\xa0±\\xa011.33. Breast (n\\xa0=\\xa039, 37.9%) and lung (n\\xa0=\\xa036, 35%) were the common original location for the primary tumors. GKSR alone without prior surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy was achieved in 81.5% (n\\xa0=\\xa084). Thirteen patients (15.1%) progressed in BM volume while finding the appearance of de novo BM in 5 (5.8%) patients. The median percentage of tumor control after radiosurgery treatment was 70% (IQR: 65-78) and only 26.2% (n\\xa0=\\xa027) of patients had >\\xa080% tumor control and stability over the median follow-up time of 5 (95% CI, 4-6) months. We found only two cases of radionecrosis (1.9%). The median survival time was 5.21 (IQR, 3-8) months. Retreatment, recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) class, and tumor stability influenced the overall survival of BM respectively (Hazard Ratio adjust (HRa)=\\xa05.610,p\\xa0=\\xa00.045; HRa=\\xa06.133,p\\xa0=\\xa00.031; HRa=\\xa022.463, p\\xa0=\\xa00.036). CONCLUSION: Stereotaxic Radiosurgery provides good results in terms of Overall survival with fewer neurocognitive disorders.RPA class and tumor control (stability) influenced the overall survival of single BM.',\n"," 'Anticancer activity of retinoic acid against breast cancer cells derived from an Iraqi patient.OBJECTIVE: Breast cancer is one of the most lethal diseases in women, both worldwide and in Iraq. The high mortality rate is attributed primarily to the chemoresistance to conventional therapeutics. The search for effective and safe treatments is critical. One promising agent that has shown activity against various cancer types is retinoic acid (RA). METHODS: RA was tested against a panel of international breast cancer cell lines and compared with Iraqi patient-derived hormone-independent breast cancer cells through MTT viability assays. Cytopathology was assessed under an inverted microscope, and apoptotic induction was evaluated with acridine orange propidium iodide assays. RESULTS: AMJ13 breast cancer cells were more sensitive to killing induced by RA than MCF-7 and CAL-51\\xa0cells. By contrast, normal HBL-100\\xa0cells showed a negligible effect. Cytological changes were observed in all cancer cells treated with RA, whereas no changes were observed in normal HBL-100\\xa0cells. Iraqi patient-derived breast cancer cells showed a higher percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis after RA treatment than the other breast cancer cells. CONCLUSION: We suggest RA as a possible breast cancer treatment with potential for clinical application with high safety.',\n"," 'Elevated expression of myosin VI contributes to breast cancer progression via MAPK/ERK signaling pathway.Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common malignancies occurring in women worldwide, and its incidence is increasing each year. Accumulating evidence indicated that Myosin VI (MYO6) functions as a gene associated with tumor progression in several cancers. However, the potential role of MYO6 and its underlying mechanisms in the development and progression of BC remains unknown. Herein, we examined the expression levels of MYO6 in BC cells and tissues by western blot and immunohistochemistry. Loss- and gain-of-function investigations in vitro were performed to determine the biological functions of MYO6. And in vivo effects of MYO6 on tumorigenesis were investigated in nude mice. Our findings showed that the expression of MYO6 was up-regulated in breast cancer, and its high expression was correlated with poor prognosis. Further investigation exhibited that silencing the expression of MYO6 significantly inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion, whereas overexpression of MYO6 enhanced these abilities in vitro. Also, reduced expression of MYO6 significantly retarded the tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) revealed that MYO6 was involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Moreover, we proved that MYO6 enhanced BC proliferation, migration and invasion via increasing the expression of phosphorylated ERK1/2. Taken together, our findings highlight the role of MYO6 in promoting BC cell progression through MAPK/ERK pathway, suggesting it may be a new potential therapeutic and prognostic target for BC patients.',\n"," 'Predicting gene mutation status via artificial intelligence technologies based on multimodal integration (MMI) to advance precision oncology.Personalized treatment strategies for cancer frequently rely on the detection of genetic alterations which are determined by molecular biology assays. Historically, these processes typically required single-gene sequencing, next-generation sequencing, or visual inspection of histopathology slides by experienced pathologists in a clinical context. In the past decade, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have demonstrated remarkable potential in assisting physicians with accurate diagnosis of oncology image-recognition tasks. Meanwhile, AI techniques make it possible to integrate multimodal data such as radiology, histology, and genomics, providing critical guidance for the stratification of patients in the context of precision therapy. Given that the mutation detection is unaffordable and time-consuming for a considerable number of patients, predicting gene mutations based on routine clinical radiological scans or whole-slide images of tissue with AI-based methods has become a hot issue in actual clinical practice. In this review, we synthesized the general framework of multimodal integration (MMI) for molecular intelligent diagnostics beyond standard techniques. Then we summarized the emerging applications of AI in the prediction of mutational and molecular profiles of common cancers (lung, brain, breast, and other tumor types) pertaining to radiology and histology imaging. Furthermore, we concluded that there truly exist multiple challenges of AI techniques in the way of its real-world application in the medical field, including data curation, feature fusion, model interpretability, and practice regulations. Despite these challenges, we still prospect the clinical implementation of AI as a highly potential decision-support tool to aid oncologists in future cancer treatment management.',\n"," 'Nanomedicine in therapeutic warfront against estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in women worldwide. Almost 70-80% of cases of BC are curable at the early non-metastatic stage. BC is a heterogeneous disease with different molecular subtypes. Around 70% of breast tumors exhibit estrogen-receptor (ER) expression and endocrine therapy is used for the treatment of these patients. However, there are high chances of recurrence in the endocrine therapy regimen. Though chemotherapy and radiation therapy have substantially improved survival rates and treatment outcomes in BC patients, there is an increased possibility of the development of resistance and dose-limiting toxicities. Conventional treatment approaches often suffer from low bioavailability, adverse effects due to the non-specific action of chemotherapeutics, and low antitumor efficacy. Nanomedicine has emerged as a conspicuous strategy for delivering anticancer therapeutics in BC management. It has revolutionized the area of cancer therapy by increasing the bioavailability of the therapeutics and improving their anticancer efficacy with reduced toxicities on healthy tissues. In this article, we have highlighted various mechanisms and pathways involved in the progression of ER-positive BC. Further, different nanocarriers delivering drugs, genes, and natural therapeutic agents for surmounting BC are the spotlights of this article.',\n"," \"Melanoma stem cell vaccine induces effective tumor immunity against melanoma.Melanoma stem cells (MSCs)-based vaccine strategies have been a potent immunotherapeutic approach for melanoma treatment, which aimed at inducing specific anti-tumor immunity and targeting cancer stem-like cells. As the main cancer-fighting immune cells, CD8(+)T cells play an important role in vaccine-induced antitumor immunity. Here, we developed a novel MSC vaccine that induces CD8(+)T cells to target melanoma stem cells specifically. The MSC vaccine was prepared for our study in order to determine the effectiveness of antitumor immunity. The proportion and activity of CD8(+)T cells were examined in the spleen after immunization, in particular, the expression and cytotoxicity of the immune checkpoint of spleen lymphocytes were detected by flow cytometry and ELISA, moreover, tumor size and the number of lung metastasis nodules were observed and the specific killing effect of the vaccine was evaluated in immunized mice. We found that the MSC vaccine could promote DCs maturation, activate CD8(+)T cells, suppress the expression of CTLA-4, PD-1, and Tim-3, and increase the expression of IFN-γ and GzmB of CD8(+)T cells. Melanoma growth and metastasis were inhibited by the vaccine's specific targeted killing effect. The vaccines based on melanoma stem cells (MSCs) delay the progression of melanoma by inducing anti-tumor immune responses in CD8(+)T cells.\",\n"," 'Ras interacting protein 1 facilitated proliferation and invasion of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cells.A GTPase binding protein, Ras interacting protein 1 (RASIP1), has been reported with a tumor-promoting role in lung cancer cells, and its role in lymphoma remains unknown. The analysis of medical databank shows that RASIP1 is upregulated in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) specimens. In this article, we demonstrated that RASIP1 is highly expressed in DLBCL cell lines, compared with primary B cells. The gain- and loss-of-function experiments were performed to investigate the effects of RASIP1 on DLBCL cells. CCK-8, flow cytometry, western blot, and transwell assays demonstrated that silence of RASIP1 inhibited proliferation, cell cycle transition, and invasion and induced significant apoptosis in DLBCL cells, and ectopic expression of RASIP1 played opposite roles. Xenograft results revealed that RASIP1 facilitated the growth of DLBCL cells in vivo. These findings suggest that RASIP1 may be required for malignancy of DLBCL cells. In addition, we also found that the expression of RASIP1 was negatively regulated by forkhead box O3 (FOXO3), which has been reported to suppress the proliferation of DLBCL cells. Our results indicate that FOXO3 is bound to the promoter sequence of RASIP1 and inhibits its transcription. The suppressive effects of FOXO3 on proliferation and invasion of DLBCL cells were neutralized by RASIP1. In conclusion, we demonstrate that FOXO3 negatively regulated RASIP1 facilitates growth and invasion of DLBCL cells, provides novel diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for DLBCL in clinic.',\n"," 'Knockdown of LINC00511 enhances radiosensitivity of lung adenocarcinoma via regulating miR-497-5p/SMAD3.As the most common histological subtype of primary lung cancer, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) causes enormous cancer deaths worldwide. Radiotherapy has been frequently used in LUAD cases, and radiosensitivity is vital for LUAD therapy. This research sought to explore the genetic factors affecting radiosensitivity in LUAD and inner mechanisms. LINC00511, miR-497-5p, and SMAD3 expression in LUAD cells were detected via qRT-PCR and western blot. CCK-8 assays, colony formation, and flow cytometry assays were employed to explore the cell viability, apoptosis, and radiosensitivity in PC-9 and A549 cells. The targeting relationship between LINC00511, miR-497-5p, and SMAD3 was verified by dual luciferase reporter assay. Furthermore, xenograft experiments were performed for the in vivo verification. In conclusion, LINC00511 was overexpressed in LUAD cells, which downregulated downstream miR-497-5p expression and mediately led to SMAD3 activation. LINC00511 downregulation suppressed cell viability while enhanced apoptosis rate in LUAD cells. Also, LINC00511 and SMAD3 were overexpressed, while miR-497-5p was downregulated in LUAD cells exposed to 4Gy irradiation treatment. Moreover, LINC00511 inhibition could block SMAD3 expression and promoted the radiosensitivity both in vitro and in vivo. These findings uncover LINC00511 knockdown promoted miR-497-5p expression and subsequently led to lower SMAD3 level, which enhanced radiosensitivity in LUAD cells. LINC00511/miR-497-5p/SMAD3 axis could be of considerable potential to enhance radiosensitivity in LUAD.',\n"," 'Immune checkpoint inhibitors as first-line therapy for non-small cell lung cancer: A systematic evaluation and meta-analysis.Recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) present promising application prospects in treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study aimed to investigate optimal treatment strategy by comparing the first-line treatment strategies with ICIs in NSCLC. We retrieved relevant studies on first-line therapy of NSCLC with ICIs. Primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary outcomes were treatment-related serious adverse events (tr-SAEs) with grade 3 or higher and objective response rate (ORR). We also conducted a Bayesian network meta-analysis. We included 14 studies involving 7,823 patients and compared seven different interventions. In PD-L1 nonselective NSCLC, nivolumab+ipilimumab had good PFS and ORR, pembrolizumab significantly prolonged OS, and nivolumab had the fewest adverse events (AEs). For PD-L1-positive patients, nivolumab remarkably prolonged OS. For those with negative PD-L1, nivolumab+ipilimumab also showed an advantage. In addition, nivolumab+ipilimumab significantly prolonged the PFS in both PD-L1-negative and -positive patients. For patients with PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) within 1-49%, atezolizumab+chemotherapy remarkably prolonged PFS and OS. For those with PD-L1 TPS ≥50%, pembrolizumab prolonged OS and atezolizumab+chemotherapy significantly prolonged PFS. Nivolumab combined with ipilimumab showed advantages in OS, PFS and ORR in most patients. Nivolumab+ipilimumab may be the optimal first-line therapy for NSCLC.',\n"," 'Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine and thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives as novel EGFR(L858R/T790M) inhibitors.EGFR mutations have been identified in 20,000 reported NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer) samples, and exon 19 deletions and L858R mutations at position 21, known as \"classical\" mutations, account for 85-90% of the total EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) mutations. In this paper, two series of EGFR kinase inhibitors were designed and synthesised. Among them, compound B1 showed an IC(50) value of 13\\u2009nM for kinase inhibitory activity against EGFR(L858R/T790M) and more than 76-fold selectivity for EGFR(WT). Furthermore, in an in\\xa0vitro anti-tumour activity test, compound B1 showed an effective anti-proliferation activity against H1975 cells with an IC(50) value of 0.087 μΜ. We also verified the mechanism of action of compound B1 as a selective inhibitor of EGFR(L858R/T790M) by cell migration assay and apoptosis assay.',\n"," 'Construction of inflammatory associated risk gene prognostic model of NSCLC and its correlation with chemotherapy sensitivity.BACKGROUND: Inflammation is an important pathogenic factor of most malignant tumors. It is essential to understand mechanism underlying inflammation and cancer development, so as to formulate and develop anti-cancer treatment strategies. However, inflammatory-related gene characterization as well as risk model construction in prognosis and response chemotherapy or immunotherapy in NSCLC are still remain unclear. METHODS: A total of 1014 lung cancer samples with RNA-seqencing results were download from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The patient cohort was randomized as a training and test cohorts, and 200 inflammatory-related genes were selected based on previously published data. Consensus clustering and Enrichment and immune function analyses base on Differential expression genes (DEGs) were performed. Prognosis Prediction Model were Constructed and Chemotherapy and immunotherapy sensitivity base on this model were performed. At last, H1299 and HCC827 cells were used to tested the mitoxantrone and oxal iplatin sensitivity after KRT6A knockdown. RESULTS: We identified the inflammatory-related genes from NSCLC datasets to build one prognosis prediction signature based on cluster inflammatory-related genes to lay a certain foundation for distinguishing high-risk NSCLC cases with dismal prognostic outcome. The nomogram provides the AUC values for 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival were 0.831, 0.853, and 0.86 in validation cohort. Morover, different sensitivity of immunotherapy or chemotherapy also were classified base on the different risk groups in NSCLC patients, which provided potent clinical reference. At last, targeting KRT6A sensitive to mitoxantrone and oxaliplatin in H1299 and HCC827 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory-related gene risk-score is the potential chemotherapeutic and immunotherapeutic biomarker for NSCLC, and targeting KRT6A sensitive to mitoxantrone and oxaliplatin in NSCLC.HighlightsInflammatory-related genes can lay a certain foundation for distinguishing high-risk NSCLC cases with dismal prognostic outcome.Risk-score base on inflammatory-related genes is positive correlated with CD274, TGFBR1 and TGFB1 expression.Targeting KRT6A sensitive to mitoxantrone and oxaliplatin in H1299 and HCC827 cells.',\n"," 'The Prognostic Nutritional Index before durvalumab after chemoradiation predict the overall survival in patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: Adjuvant durvalumab after chemoradiation has become the standard of care for patients with stage III NSCLC, according to the PACIFIC trial. Whether biomarkers before durvalumab for patients with stage III NSCLC showed predictive and prognostic effects remains unknown. METHODS: This is a retrospective study in the Fujieda Municipal General Hospital between October 2018 and March 2022. We assessed the predictive value of the Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI) in stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with durvalumab after chemoradiation. RESULTS: After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the study included 56 patients for further analysis. The median follow-up period was 17.6\\u2009months (range, 3.0-45.4\\u2009months). According to receiver operating characteristic curve results, the PNI cutoff value to predict overall survival (OS) was 37.9, with sensitivity and specificity at 67.9% and 67.9%. Accordingly, the patients were divided into low- and high-PNI groups. Patients with the low-PNI group had a significantly shorter progression-free survival compared to the high-PNI group (median, 9.1 vs. 21.3\\u2009months, p\\u2009=\\u20090.032). OS was also shorter in the low-PNI group (median, 19.0 months vs. not reached, p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). In the multivariate Cox hazards regression analyses, the high-PNI was an independent prognostic factor for OS (hazard ratio, 0.187; 95% confidence interval, 0.046-0.760; p\\u2009=\\u20090.019). It seems that PNI could be used as a predictor for OS in patients with stage III NSCLC treated with durvalumab after chemoradiation.KEY MESSAGESInadequate immunocompetence and nutritional status after chemoradiation therapy may result in poor antitumor efficacy of ICIs.Pretreatment immune and nutritional assessment using PNI could be considered an independent predictor for the survival of stage III NSCLC patients treated with durvalumab after chemoradiation therapy.',\n"," 'Triple targeting of mutant EGFR(L858R/T790M), COX-2, and 15-LOX: design and synthesis of novel quinazolinone tethered phenyl urea derivatives for anti-inflammatory and anticancer evaluation.We designed and synthesised novel quinazolinone tethered phenyl urea derivatives (6a-p) that triple target the double mutant EGFR(L858R/T790M), COX-2, and 15-LOX. Compounds (6e, 6d, 6j, 6m, and 6n) not only had low micromolar IC50 inhibitory activities against the three targets, but they also showed good selectivity for COX-2 over COX-1 and for EGFR(L858R/T790M) over wild-type EGFR. Except for 6e and 6n, all of the tested compounds inhibited the NO production significantly more potently than celecoxib, diclofenac, and indomethacin. Compounds 6i and 6k reduced ROS levels more effectively than celecoxib and diclofenac. In terms of inhibiting TNF-α production, 6o-treated cells showed TNF-α level, which is ∼10 times lower than celecoxib. Furthermore, 6e and 6j had the highest anticancer activity against the breast cancer cell line BT-459 with growth inhibition percentages of 67.14 and 70.07%, respectively. Docking studies confirm their favoured binding affinity. The proposed compounds could be promising multi-targeted leads.',\n"," 'Research progress and value of albumin-related inflammatory markers in the prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer: a review of clinical evidence.Inflammatory markers have a wide range of predictive values in the prognosis of non-small lung cancer (NSCLC). Poor nutritional status usually means a poor prognosis in patients with NSCLC, which is widely recognized by oncologists and nutritionists. Serum albumin has a certain value in evaluating the prognosis of patients. Several inflammatory albumin-related markers have been proposed, but they have not been widely used in predicting the prognosis of NSCLC in clinical practice. We aim to systematically review the published clinical evidence of albumin-related inflammatory markers in predicting the prognosis of NSCLC and to describe their progress and value. The results showed that the markers included in the review could be prognostic indicators in patients with NSCLC. However, we found that the cut-off value of albumin-related inflammatory markers with quantitative nature was very chaotic and needed to be defined by recognized standards. We summarized and compared the advantages and disadvantages of these markers, but a prospective cohort study with long-term follow-up after adjustment for important confounders is still necessary. Whether the results and conclusions could be directly applied in clinical practice needs to be identified and evaluated. There is an urgent need to classify and standardize the albumin-related inflammatory markers that play an important role in the prognosis of NSCLC, which is the key to ensuring the transformation from clinical study to clinical application.',\n"," \"Recent research advances on simulation modeling of temperature distribution in microwave ablation of lung tumors.Lung tumor is the first malignant tumor with the highest mortality, but only no more than one-third of patients can be treated by surgical resection. Microwave ablation (MWA) has become a new adjuvant therapeutic mean for lung tumors because of its low trauma, short treatment time, large ablation volume and wide application range. However, the treatment parameters of MWA, such as input power and ablation time, still depend on the doctors' experience, which leads to the ineffectiveness of MWA. Therefore, the accurate modeling of temperature distribution of lung tumor MWA has become a significant technical problem to be solved. Recent research was devoted to personalized characterization of lung tumor parameters, finite element analysis of temperature distribution in MWA and accurate ablation effect evaluation. In this paper, a review of the recently obtained results and data will be presented and discussed.\",\n"," \"Thyroid hormones as biomarkers of lung cancer: a retrospective study.BACKGROUND: Thyroid hormones are key regulators of several physiological processes, including differentiation, embryonic development, proliferation, and metabolism. Several prospective studies have shown a relationship between hyperthyroidism and cancer incidence; however, since the association between thyroid hormone levels and lung cancer remains controversial, this study aimed to determine the correlation between the same. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 289 patients, who were diagnosed with lung cancer at the Huzhou Central Hospital between January 2016 and January 2021, and 238 healthy subjects. The baseline clinical data of two groups were collected. The concentrations of thyroid hormones, tumor CEA, CYF, SCC, and NSE in both the lung cancer patient and healthy volunteer groups were analyzed. Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney test was used to compare continuous variables. A chi-square test was adopted to estimate the relationship between serum thyroid hormones level and clinical characteristics of lung cancer cases. ROC curve analyses were used to determine the characteristics of thyroid hormones for recognizing lung cancer. RESULTS: The results showed that serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), total thyroxine, total triiodothyronine, and free triiodothyronine (FT3) levels were significantly decreased, while free thyroxine (FT4) levels were increased in patients with lung cancer. In addition, FT3 was identified as a potential diagnostic biomarker of stage I-IV lung cancer with the area under the curve values of 0.807. What's more, FT3 and FT4 were used in combination with CEA and were identified as potential diagnostic biomarkers of stage 0 lung cancer (Tis) with the area under the curve values of 0.774. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the possibility of using thyroid hormones as innovative diagnostic markers for lung cancer.\",\n"," 'Incidence, prognostic factors and a nomogram of cervical cancer with distant organ metastasis: a SEER-based study.This study was to investigate the incidence, survival and prognostic factors of cervical cancer with distant organ metastasis, and to develop a nomogram to predict the prognosis of cervical cancer. We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database to screen patients diagnosed with cervical cancer from 2010 to 2014. The chi-squared test was used to analyse the differences in clinical characteristics, and we used Kaplan-Meier methods to perform survival analysis. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate prognostic factors, and we developed a visual nomogram to judge the prognosis. We found that lung metastasis was the most common in cervical cancer patients with distant organ metastasis. Age, race, characteristics of the tumour, and therapy should be considered when analysing the prognosis of cervical cancer patients. The findings of this study may help clinicians to formulate individualised treatment strategies.Impact StatementWhat is already known on this subject? Distant organ metastasis of cervical cancer mainly involves lung, bone, liver and brain. Once it occurs, the survival and prognosis will be threatened seriously.What the results of this study add? 4176 patients were included, and lung metastasis was the most common in cervical cancer with distant organ metastasis (3.5%). Additionally, age, race, tumour grade, histological type, T-stage, N-stage, lung, liver and bone metastasis and the treatment mode are significantly related to the outcomes of cervical cancer patients. Furthermore, we developed a nomogram that could predict the probability of three-year and five-year OS.What the implications are of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? The findings of this study may drive more and more studies focussing on the comprehensive prognostic assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of distant metastasis of cervical cancer. Besides, clinicians can utilise these findings to formulate individualised treatment strategies.',\n"," 'Effectiveness of ALK inhibitors in treatment of CNS metastases in NSCLC patients.Metastases to the central nervous system (CNS) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer constitute an extremely difficult clinical problem, and their occurrence is associated with a poor prognosis. Due to the existence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the action of proteins responsible for the transport of drugs, e.g. P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the penetration of drugs into the CNS is insufficient. Until recently, the only method of CNS metastases treatment was radiotherapy and neurosurgery. The advancement of molecular biology allowed discover targets for molecularly targeted therapies. One of targets is abnormal anaplastic lymphoma kinase, which results from the rearrangement of the ALK gene in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). ALK rearrangement occurs in only about 4.5% of NSCLC patients, but its presence favors brain metastases. The ALK inhibitors (ALKi) were modified to obtain molecules with high ability to penetrate into the CNS. This was achieved by modifying the structure of individual molecules, which became, inter alia, less substrates for P-gp. These modifications caused that less than 10% of patients experience progression in CNS during new ALK inhibitors treatment. This review summarizes the knowledge about the action of BBB, the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of ALKi, with particular emphasis on their ability to penetrate the CNS and the intracranial activity of individual drugs from different generations of ALK inhibitors.',\n"," 'COL28 promotes proliferation, migration, and EMT of renal tubular epithelial cells.Type XXVIII collagen (COL28) is involved in cancer and lung fibrosis. COL28 polymorphisms and mutations might be involved in kidney fibrosis, but the exact role of COL28 in renal fibrosis is unknown. This study explored the function of COL28 in renal tubular cells by examining the expression of COL28 mRNA and the effects of COL28 overexpression in human tubular cells. COL28 mRNA expression and localization were observed in normal and fibrotic kidney tissues from humans and mice using real-time PCR, western blot, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry. The consequences of COL28 overexpression on cell proliferation, migration, cell polarity, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induced by TGF-β1 were examined in human tubular HK-2 cells. COL28 expression was low in human normal renal tissues, mainly observed in the renal tubular epithelial cells and especially in proximal renal tubules. COL28 protein expression in human and mouse obstructive kidney disease was higher than in normal tissues (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05) and more significant in the UUO2-Week than the UUO1-Week group. The overexpression of COL28 promoted HK-2 cell proliferation and enhanced their migration ability (all p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). TGF-β1 (10\\u2009ng/ml) induced COL28 mRNA expression in HK-2 cells, decreased E-cadherin and increased α-SMA in the COL28-overexpression group compared with controls (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). ZO-1 expression decreased while COL6 increased in the COL28-overexpression group compared with controls (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). In conclusion, COL28 overexpression promotes the migration and proliferation of renal tubular epithelial cells. The EMT could also be involved. COL28 could be a therapeutic target against renal- fibrotic diseases.',\n"," 'Evaluation of the relationship of the T and M stage with the erector spinae muscle area in male lung cancer patients.OBJECTIVES: Sarcopenia is very common due to cachexia and presents with a decrease in skeletal muscle mass. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between the T, M category and the erector spinae muscle area (ESMa). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The initial first thorax and high-resolution computed tomography (CT) of patients with lung cancer between 2015 and 2019 were retrospectively screened. After exclusion criterias remaining 226 male patients constituted the study group. ESMa was measured manually in the section taken from the T12 vertebra spinous process level as previously described in the literature and its relationship with the T and M stage were evaluated. RESULTS: The mean ages of patients were 70\\u2009±\\u20099.57\\u2009years. The T stage was T1 in 34 (15%) patients, T2 in 46 (20.4%), T3 in 59 (26.1%), and T4 in 87 (38.5%). Metastasis was detected in 83 (36.7%) patients. The mean ESMa of the patients was 34.15\\u2009±\\u20097.21\\u2009mm(2) and did not differ according to the T stage (p\\u2009=\\u2009.39). ESMa was lower in the metastatic group (mean 30.42\\u2009±\\u20096.38\\u2009mm(2)) than the non-metastatic group (mean 36.32\\u2009±\\u20096.78\\u2009mm(2)) (p\\u2009=\\u2009.0001). CONCLUSIONS: ESMa, one of the indicators of sarcopenia, is lower in patients with metastatic lung cancer than in nonmetastatic.',\n"," 'A novel nomogram for predicting the decision to delayed extubation after thoracoscopic lung cancer surgery.OBJECTIVE: Delayed extubation was commonly associated with increased adverse outcomes. This study aimed to explore the incidence and predictors and to construct a nomogram for delayed extubation after thoracoscopic lung cancer surgery. METHODS: We reviewed medical records of 8716 consecutive patients undergoing this surgical treatment from January 2016 to December 2017. Using potential predictors to develop a nomogram and using a bootstrap-resampling approach to conduct internal validation. For external validation, we additionally pooled 3676 consecutive patients who underwent this procedure between January 2018 and June 2018. Extubation performed outside the operating room was defined as delayed extubation. RESULTS: The rate of delayed extubation was 1.60%. Multivariate analysis identified age, BMI, FEV(1)/FVC, lymph nodes calcification, thoracic paravertebral blockade (TPVB) usage, intraoperative transfusion, operative time and operation later than 6 p.m. as independent predictors for delayed extubation. Using these eight candidates to develop a nomogram, with a concordance statistic (C-statistic) value of 0.798 and good calibration. After internal validation, similarly good calibration and discrimination (C-statistic, 0.789; 95%CI, 0.748 to 0.830) were observed. The decision curve analysis (DCA) indicated the positive net benefit with the threshold risk range of 0 to 30%. Goodness-of-fit test and discrimination in the external validation were 0.113 and 0.785, respectively. CONCLUSION: The proposed nomogram can reliably identify patients at high risk for the decision to delayed extubation after thoracoscopic lung cancer surgery. Optimizing four modifiable factors including BMI, FEV(1)/FVC, TPVB usage, and operation later than 6 p.m. may reduce the risk of delayed extubation.Key Messages:This study identified eight independent predictors for delayed extubation, among which lymph node calcification and anaesthesia type were not commonly reported.Using these eight candidates to develop a nomogram, we could reliably identify high-risk patients for the decision to delayed extubation.Optimizing four modifiable factors, including BMI, FEV(1)/FVC, TPVB usage, and operation later than 6 p.m. may reduce the risk of delayed extubation.',\n"," \"CircDHRS3 inhibits prostate cancer cell proliferation and metastasis through the circDHRS3/miR-421/MEIS2 axis.Prostate cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer among men worldwide. The importance of circular RNA (circRNA) in prostate cancer and its connection to malignancy has been steadily recognized. circRNA expression was obtained by circRNA sequencing of prostate cancer. circRNA and its function were further analysed. The results were verified by qRT-PCR, RIP assay, FISH, RNA pulldown, WB, CCK-8, colony formation assay and wound-healing assay. BALB/c Nude mice were used for xenograft hosts. Low expression of circDHRS3 was assessed in prostate cancer. Overexpression of circDHRS3 inhibited prostate cancer growth and migration in vitro. Additionally, miR-421 was shown to be the downstream target of circDHRS3, as shown by fluorescence in situ hybridization and dual-luciferase experiments. The rescue assay results for the PC3 and Du145 cell lines demonstrated that circDHRS3 inhibits prostate cancer cell lines' ability to proliferate and metastasize by modulating MEIS2 expression through the circDHRS3/miR-421/MEIS2 axis. In vivo investigations confirmed that the overexpression of circDHRS3 could inhibit both the lung and bone metastasis of prostate cancer cells. circDHRS3 has the potential to become a biomarker and a targeted therapeutic site for prostate cancer, particularly in the malignant stage. Our study indicates that circDHRS3 inhibits prostate cancer cell proliferation and metastasis through the circDHRS3/miR-421/MEIS2 axis.\",\n"," 'Baicalein attenuates bleomycin-induced lung fibroblast senescence and lung fibrosis through restoration of Sirt3 expression.CONTEXT: Fibroblast senescence was reported to contribute to the pathological development of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and baicalein is reported to attenuate IPF. OBJECTIVE: This study explores whether baicalein attenuates lung fibrosis by regulating lung fibroblast senescence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice were randomly assigned to control, bleomycin (BLM), baicalein and BLM\\u2009+\\u2009baicalein groups. Lung fibrosis was established by a single intratracheal dose of BLM (3\\u2009mg/kg). The baicalein group received baicalein orally (100\\u2009mg/kg/day). Sirtuin 3 (Sirt3) siRNA (50\\u2009μg) was injected through the tail vein once a week for 2\\xa0weeks to explore its effect on the anti-pulmonary fibrosis of baicalein. RESULTS: BLM-treated mice exhibited obvious lung fibrosis and fibroblast senescence by showing increased levels of collagen deposition (27.29% vs. 4.14%), hydroxyproline (208.05 vs. 40.16\\u2009ng/mg), collagen I (25.18 vs. 9.15\\u2009μg/mg), p53, p21, p16, MCP-1, PAI-1, TNF-α, MMP-10 and MMP-12 in lung tissues, which were attenuated by baicalein. Baicalein also mitigated BLM-mediated activation of TGF-β1/Smad signalling pathway. Baicalein restored the BLM-induced downregulation of Sirt3 expression in lung tissues and silencing of Sirt3 abolished the inhibitory role of baicalein against BLM-induced lung fibrosis, fibroblast senescence and activation of TGF-β1/Smad signalling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Baicalein preserved the BLM-induced downregulation of lung Sirt3 expression, and thus the suppression of TGF-β1/Smad signalling pathway and lung fibrosis, which might provide an experimental basis for treatment of IPF.',\n"," 'Targeted next-generation sequencing for the detection of cancer-associated somatic mutations in adenomyosis.Adenomyosis is a condition characterised by the invasion of endometrial tissues into the uterine myometrium, the molecular pathogenesis of which remains incompletely elucidated. Lesion profiling with next-generation sequencing (NGS) can lead to the identification of previously unanticipated causative genes and the detection of therapeutically actionable genetic changes. Using an NGS panel that included 275 cancer susceptibility genes, this study examined the occurrence and frequency of somatic mutations in adenomyotic tissue specimens collected from 17 women. Extracted DNA was enriched using targeted formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue cores prior to the identification of lesion-specific variants. The results revealed that KRAS and AT-rich interactive domain 1A (ARID1A) were the two most frequently mutated genes (mutation frequencies: 24% and 12%, respectively). Notably, endometrial atypical hyperplasia did not involve adenomyotic areas. We also identified, for the first time, two potentially pathogenic mutations in the F-box/WD repeat-containing protein 7 (FBXW7) and cohesin subunit SA-2 (STAG2) genes. These findings indicate that mutations in the KRAS, ARID1A, FBXW7 and STAG2 genes may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of adenomyosis. Additional studies are needed to assess whether the utilisation of oncogenic driver mutations can inform the surveillance of patients with adenomyosis who had not undergone hysterectomy.Impact statementWhat is already known on this subject? Although somatic point mutations in the KRAS oncogene have been recently detected in adenomyosis, the molecular underpinnings of this condition remains incompletely elucidated.

Here, we confirmed that LL-37 expression enhanced endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration and invasion in HCC cells. And the HER2/EGFR-MAPK/ERK signal participated in the process above. More frequent lung metastases were observed in an LL-37-overexpressing hematogenous metastasis model. Interestingly, 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) together with si-LL-37 significantly enhanced 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-induced inhibition of migration and invasion in PLC/PRF-5 cells, and also enhanced reversion of the EMT process. Therefore, LL-37 is involved in HCC metastases, and may act as an important factor to attenuate the inhibitory activity of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) on HCC metastasis. Targeting hCAP18/LL-37 may offer a potential strategy to improve the anticancer activity of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) in HCC therapy.',\n"," 'RNA-Binding Proteins as a Molecular Link between COPD and Lung Cancer.Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) represents an independent risk factor for lung cancer development. Accelerated cell senescence, induced by oxidative stress and inflammation, is a common pathogenic determinant of both COPD and lung cancer. The post transcriptional regulation of genes involved in these processes is finely regulated by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), which regulate mRNA turnover, subcellular localization, splicing and translation. Multiple pro-inflammatory mediators (including cytokines, chemokines, proteins, growth factors and others), responsible of lung microenvironment alteration, are regulated by RBPs. Several mouse models have shown the implication of RBPs in multiple mechanisms that sustain chronic inflammation and neoplastic transformation. However, further studies are required to clarify the role of RBPs in the pathogenic mechanisms shared by lung cancer and COPD, in order to identify novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. This review will therefore focus on the studies collectively indicating the role of RBPs in oxidative stress and chronic inflammation as common pathogenic mechanisms shared by lung cancer and COPD.',\n"," 'Discovery of new pyridine-quinoline hybrids as competitive and non-competitive PIM-1 kinase inhibitors with apoptosis induction and caspase 3/7 activation capabilities.New quinoline-pyridine hybrids were designed and synthesised as PIM-1/2 kinase inhibitors. Compounds 5b, 5c, 6e, 13a, 13c, and 14a showed in-vitro low cytotoxicity against normal human lung fibroblast Wi-38 cell line and potent in-vitro anticancer activity against myeloid leukaemia (NFS-60), liver (HepG-2), prostate (PC-3), and colon (Caco-2) cancer cell lines. In addition, 6e, 13a, and 13c significantly induced apoptosis with percentage more than 66%. Moreover, 6e, 13a, and 13c significantly induced caspase 3/7 activation in HepG-2 cell line. Furthermore, 5c, 6e, and 14a showed potent in-vitro PIM-1 kinase inhibitory activity. While, 5b showed potent in-vitro PIM-2 kinase inhibitory activity. Kinetic studies using Lineweaver-Burk double-reciprocal plot indicated that 5b, 5c, 6e, and 14a behaved as competitive inhibitors while 13a behaved as both competitive and non-competitive inhibitor of PIM-1 kinase enzyme. Molecular docking studies indicated that, in-silico affinity came in coherence with the observed in-vitro inhibitory activities against PIM-1/2 kinases.',\n"," 'Effect of epithelial-specific MyD88 signaling pathway on airway inflammatory response to organic dust exposure.The Toll-like receptor (TLR) adaptor protein MyD88 is integral to airway inflammatory response to microbial-enriched organic dust extract (ODE) exposures. ODE-induced airway neutrophil influx and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines was essentially abrogated in global MyD88-deficient mice, yet these mice demonstrate an increase in airway epithelial cell mucin expression. To further elucidate the role of MyD88-dependent responses specific to lung airway epithelial cells in response to ODE in\\xa0vivo, the surfactant protein C protein (SPC) Cre(+) embryologic expressing airway epithelial cells floxed for MyD88 to disrupt MyD88 signaling were utilized. The inducible club cell secretory protein (CCSP) Cre(+), MyD88 floxed, were also developed. Using an established protocol, mice were intranasally instilled with ODE or saline once or daily up to 3\\u2009weeks. Mice with MyD88-deficient SPC(+) lung epithelial cells exhibited decreased neutrophil influx following ODE exposure once and repetitively for 1\\u2009week without modulation of classic pro-inflammatory mediators including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and neutrophil chemoattractants. This protective response was lost after 3\\u2009weeks of repetitive exposure. ODE-induced Muc5ac mucin expression at 1\\u2009week was also reduced in MyD88-deficient SPC(+) cells. Acute ODE-induced IL-33 was reduced in MyD88-deficient SPC(+) cells whereas serum IgE levels were increased at one week. In contrast, mice with inducible MyD88-deficient CCSP(+) airway epithelial cells demonstrated no significant difference in experimental indices following ODE exposure. Collectively, these findings suggest that MyD88-dependent signaling targeted to all airway epithelial cells plays an important role in mediating neutrophil influx and mucin production in response to acute organic dust exposures.',\n"," 'Malignant mesothelioma of the peritoneum mimicking primary peritonitis carcinomatosis..',\n"," 'Structure-activity exploration of a small-molecule allosteric inhibitor of T790M/L858R double mutant EGFR.EGFR is a protein kinase whose aberrant activity is frequently involved in the development of non-small lung cancer (NSCLC) drug resistant forms. The allosteric inhibition of this enzyme is currently one among the most attractive approaches to design and develop anticancer drugs. In a previous study, we reported the identification of a hit compound acting as type III allosteric inhibitor of the L858R/T790M double mutant EGFR. Herein, we report the design, synthesis and in\\xa0vitro testing of a series of analogues of the previously identified hit with the aim of exploring the structure-activity relationships (SAR) around this scaffold. The performed analyses allowed us to identify two compounds 15 and 18 showing improved inhibition of double mutant EGFR with respect to the original hit, as well as interesting antiproliferative activity against H1975 NSCLC cancer cells expressing double mutant EGFR. The newly discovered compounds represent promising starting points for further hit-to-lead optimisation.',\n"," 'Identification of the first-in-class dual inhibitors of human DNA topoisomerase IIα and indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO 1) with strong anticancer properties.Molecular docking of a large set of thiosemicarbazide-based ligands resulted in obtaining compounds that inhibited both human DNA topoisomerase IIα and indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO1). To the best of our knowledge, these compounds are the first dual inhibitors targeting these two enzymes. As both of them participate in the anticancer response, the effect of the compounds on a panel of cancer cell lines was examined. Among the cell lines tested, lung cancer (A549) and melanoma (A375) cells were the most sensitive to compounds 1 (IC(50)=0.23\\u2009µg/ml), 2 (IC(50)=0.83\\u2009µg/ml) and 3 (IC(50)=0.25\\u2009µg/ml). The observed activity was even 90-fold higher than that of etoposide, with selectivity index values reaching 125. In-silico simulations showed that contact between 1-3 and human DNA topoisomerase II was maintained through aromatic moieties located at limiting edges of ligand molecules and intensive interactions of the thiosemicarbazide core with the DNA fragments present in the catalytic site of the enzyme.',\n"," 'Biological evaluation, docking studies, and in silico ADME prediction of some pyrimidine and pyridine derivatives as potential EGFR(WT) and EGFR(T790M) inhibitors.Herein, a set of pyridine and pyrimidine derivatives were assessed for their impact on the cell cycle and apoptosis.

However, the target AIMP2-DX2, AIMP2-lacking exon 2, is often detected in many cancer patients and cells. The predominant approach for targeting AIMP-DX2 has been attempted via small molecule mediated inhibition, but due to the lack of satisfactory activity against AIMP2-DX2, new therapeutic strategies are needed to develop a novel drug for AIMP2-DX2. Here, we report the use of the PROTAC strategy that combines small-molecule AIMP2-DX2 inhibitors with selective E3-ligase ligands with optimised linkers. Consequently, candidate compound 45 was found to be a degrader of AIMP2-DX2. Together, these findings demonstrate that our PROTAC technology targeting AIMP2-DX2 would be a potential new strategy for future lung cancer treatment.',\n"," 'Development of 10-Hydroxycamptothecin-crizotinib conjugate based on the synergistic effect on lung cancer cells.The effect of the combination of 10-Hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) and crizotinib (CRI) on EGFR- and KRAS-mutant lung cancer cells was investigated and the conjugates of the two drugs were synthesised. HCPT combined with CRI synergistically inhibited the cell growth and proliferation of H1975, HCC827, and H460 without aggravating adverse effect on the normal cells. The combination synergistically enhanced the cell apoptosis rate through releasing Cyto-C by activation of Bcl-2 family-mediated mitochondrial signalling, which was associate with inactivating of EGFR related downstream signalling pathways including AKT, ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK. Based on this synergy, the conjugates of HCPT and CRI (compounds CH-1 and CH-2) with different chemical bonds were synthesised. Compound CH-1 exhibited stronger cytotoxicity than HCPT and CRI alone or in combination. The combination of HCPT and CRI might be a promising therapeutic regimen and the conjugate CH-1was a potential target drug for the treatment of lung cancer.',\n"," 'In\\xa0vitro bio-characterization of solid lipid nanoparticles of favipiravir in A549 human lung epithelial cancer cells.OBJECTIVES: Lung cancer is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. In lung cancer treatment, nebulized solid lipid nanoparticles may be a viable drug delivery method, helping the drug reach sites of action, and improving its inhalation efficiency and pulmonary deposition. This research focused on evaluating the effectiveness of solid lipid nanoparticles of favipiravir (Fav-SLNps) in facilitating drug delivery to sites of action in lung cancer treatment. METHODS: The hot-evaporation method was used to formulate Fav-SLNps. The in\\xa0vitro cell viability, anti-cancer effects, and cellular uptake activity were evaluated in A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells treated with the Fav-SLNp formulation. RESULTS: The Fav-SLNps were formulated successfully. Importantly, Fav-SLNps at a concentration of 322.6\\xa0μg/ml were found to be safe and non-toxic toward A549\\xa0cells in\\xa0vitro. The formulation had potential anti-proliferative properties via increasing the proportions of cells in G2/M and G0/G1 phases to 1.20 and 1.13 times those in untreated cells. Additionally, Fav-SLNp treatment significantly induced necrosis in A549\\xa0cells. Furthermore, the use of SLNps in the Fav formulation resulted in a macrophage drug uptake 1.23 times that of the free drug. CONCLUSION: Our results confirmed the internalization and anti-cancer activity of the Fav-SLNp formulation in the A549 lung cancer cell line. Our findings suggest that Fav-SLNps could potentially be used as lung cancer treatment to facilitate drug delivery to sites of action in the lungs.',\n"," 'Regulating POLR3G by MicroRNA-26a-5p as a promising therapeutic target of lung cancer stemness and chemosensitivity.Cancer stem cells (CSCs) identified in lung cancer exhibit resistance to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and targeted therapy. Therefore, a technology for controlling CSCs is needed to overcome such resistance to cancer therapy. Various evidences about the association between epithelial-mesenchymal transition related transcriptomic alteration and acquisition of CSC phenotype have been proposed recently. Down-regulated miR-26a-5p is closely related to mesenchymal-like lung cancer cell lines. These findings suggest that miR-26a-5p might be involved in lung cancer stemness. RNA polymerase III subunit G (POLR3G) was selected as a candidate target of miR-26a-5p related to cancer stemness. It was found that miR-26a-5p directly regulates the expression of POLR3G.Overexpression of miR-26a-5p induced a marked reduction of colony formation and sphere formation. Co-treatment of miR-26a-5p and paclitaxel decreased cell growth, suggesting that miR-26a-5p might play a role as a chemotherapy sensitizer. In the cancer genome atlas data, high miR-26a-5p and low POLR3G expression were also related to higher survival rate of patients with lung adenocarcinoma. These results suggest that miR-26a-5p can suppress lung cancer stemness and make cancer cell become sensitive to chemotherapy. This finding provides a novel insight into a potential lung cancer treatment by regulating stemness.',\n"," 'Lung cancer screening in the healthcare system of Bosnia and Herzegovina.Lung cancer incidence in Bosnia and Hercegovina is high. The implementation of evidence-based lung cancer screening based on low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) may detect lung cancer early and decrease mortality specific to lung cancer.

In this paper, we propose a framework for the implementation of lung cancer screening in primary healthcare of Bosnia and Herzegovina based on the United States Preventative Services Task Force recommendation from 2021 and the American College of Radiology Lung CT Screening Reporting & Data System from 2022.',\n"," 'Elemene induces cell apoptosis via inhibiting glutathione synthesis in lung adenocarcinoma.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The rhizome of Curcuma wenyujin Y.H. Chen & C. Ling, also known as Wen-E-Zhu, has been used for cancer treatment since ancient times, with roots dating back to the Song Dynasty. Elemene (EE), a sesquiterpene extract with potent anticancer properties, is extracted from Wen-E-Zhu, with β-elemene (BE) being its main active compound, along with trace amounts of β-caryophyllene (BC), γ-elemene and δ-elemene isomers. EE has demonstrated broad-spectrum anti-cancer effects and is commonly used in clinical treatments for various types of malignant cancers, including lung cancer. Studies have shown that EE can arrest the cell cycle, inhibit cancer cell proliferation, and induce apoptosis and autophagy. However, the exact mechanism of its anti-lung cancer activity remains unclear and requires further research and investigation. AIM OF THE STUDY: In this study, the possible mechanism of EE and its main active components, BE and BC, against lung adenocarcinoma was investigated by using A549 and PC9 cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The subcutaneous tumor model of nude mice was constructed to evaluate the efficacy of EE in vivo, then the in vitro half-inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of EE and its main active components, BE and BC, on A549 and PC9 cells at different concentrations were determined by CCK-8. Flow cytometry was used to detect the apoptosis and cycle of A549 and PC9 cells treated with different concentrations of BE and BC for 24\\xa0h. Non-targeted metabolomics analysis was performed on A549\\xa0cells to explore potential target pathways, which were subsequently verified through kit detection and western blot analysis. RESULTS: Injection of EE in A549 tumor-bearing mice effectively suppressed cancer growth in vivo. The IC(50) of EE and its main active components, BE and BC, was around 60\\xa0μg/mL. Flow cytometry analysis showed that BE and BC blocked the G(2)/M and S phases of lung adenocarcinoma cells and induced apoptosis, leading to a significant reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Results from non-targeted metabolomics analysis indicated that the glutathione metabolism pathway in A549\\xa0cells was altered after treatment with the active components. Kit detection revealed a decrease in glutathione (GSH) levels and an increase in the levels of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and reactive oxygen (ROS). Supplementation of GSH reduced the inhibitory activity of the active components on lung cancer and also decreased the ROS content of cells. Analysis of glutathione synthesis-related proteins showed a decrease in the expression of glutaminase, cystine/glutamate reverse transporter (SLC7A11), and glutathione synthase (GS), while the expression of glutamate cysteine ligase modified subunit (GCLM) was increased. In the apoptosis-related pathway, Bax protein and cleaved caspase-9/caspase-9 ratio were up-regulated and Bcl-2 protein was down-regulated. CONCLUSIONS: EE, BE, and BC showed significant inhibitory effects on the growth of lung adenocarcinoma cells, and the mechanism of action was linked to the glutathione system. By down-regulating the expression of proteins related to GSH synthesis, EE and its main active components BE and BC disrupted the cellular redox system and thereby promoted cell apoptosis.',\n"," 'Corrigendum to \"Disclosing targets and pharmacological mechanisms of total bioflavonoids extracted from Selaginella doederleinii against non-small cell lung cancer by combination of network pharmacology and proteomics\" [J.

For these reasons, microphysiological systems, organ-on-chip and multiorgans microdevices attracted considerable attention as novel tools for high-throughput and high-content research to achieve an improved understanding of diseases and to accelerate the drug development process towards more precise and eventually personalized standards. This review takes the form of a guide on this fast-growing field, providing useful introduction to major themes and indications for further readings. We start analyzing Organs-on-chips (OOC) technologies for testing the major drug administration routes: (1) oral/rectal route by intestine-on-a-chip, (2) inhalation by lung-on-a-chip, (3) transdermal by skin-on-a-chip and (4) intravenous through vascularization models, considering how drugs penetrate in the bloodstream and are conveyed to their targets. Then, we focus on OOC models for (other) specific organs and diseases: (1) neurodegenerative diseases with brain models and blood brain barriers, (2) tumor models including their vascularization, organoids/spheroids, engineering and screening of antitumor drugs, (3) liver/kidney on chips and multiorgan models for gastrointestinal diseases and metabolic assessment of drugs and (4) biomechanical systems recapitulating heart, muscles and bones structures and related diseases. Successively, we discuss technologies and materials for organ on chips, analyzing (1) microfluidic tools for organs-on-chips, (2) sensor integration for real-time monitoring, (3) materials and (4) cell lines for organs on chips. (Nano)delivery approaches for therapeutics and their on chip assessment are also described. Finally, we conclude with a critical discussion on current significance/relevance, trends, limitations, challenges and future prospects in terms of revolutionary impact on biomedical research, preclinical models and drug development.',\n"," 'Autologous exosome facilitates load and target delivery of bioactive peptides to repair spinal cord injury.Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes motor, sensory and automatic impairment due to rarely axon regeneration. Developing effective treatment for SCI in the clinic is extremely challenging because of the restrictive axonal regenerative ability and disconnection of neural elements after injury, as well as the limited systemic drug delivery efficiency caused by blood spinal cord barrier. To develop an effective non-invasive treatment strategy for SCI in clinic, we generated an autologous plasma exosome (AP-EXO) based biological scaffold where AP-EXO was loaded with neuron targeting peptide (RVG) and growth-facilitating peptides (ILP and ISP). This scaffold can be targeted delivered to neurons in the injured area and elicit robust axon regrowth across the lesion core to the levels over 30-fold greater than naïve treatment, thus reestablish the intraspinal circuits and promote motor functional recovery after spinal cord injury in mice. More importantly, in ex vivo, human plasma exosomes (HP-EXO) loaded with combinatory peptides of RVG, ILP and ISP showed safety and no liver and kidney toxicity in the application to nude SCI mice. Combining the efficacy and safety, the AP-EXO-based personalized treatment confers functional recovery after SCI and showed immense promising in biomedical applications in treating SCI. It is helpful to expand the application of combinatory peptides and human plasma derived autologous exosomes in promoting regeneration and recovery upon SCI treatment.',\n"," 'Protein adsorption determines pulmonary cell uptake of lipid-based nanoparticles.The inhalable administration of lipid nanoparticles is an effective strategy for localised delivery of therapeutics against various lung diseases. Of this, improved intracellular delivery of pharmaceuticals for infectious disease and cancer management is of high significance. However, the influence of lipid nanoparticle composition and structure on uptake in pulmonary cell lines, especially in the presence of biologically relevant media is poorly understood. Here, the uptake of lamellar (liposomes) versus non-lamellar (cubosomes) lipid nanoparticles in macrophages and lung epithelial cells was quantified and the influence of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), containing native pulmonary protein and surfactant molecules is determined. Cubosome uptake in both macrophages and epithelial cells was strongly mediated by a high percentage of molecular function regulatory and binding proteins present within the protein corona. In contrast, the protein corona did not influence the uptake of liposomes in epithelial cells. In macrophages, the proteins mediated a rapid internalisation, followed by exocytosis of liposomes after 6\\xa0h incubation. These findings on the influence of biological fluid in regulating lipid nanoparticle uptake mechanisms may guide future development of optimal intracellular delivery systems for therapeutics via the pulmonary route.',\n"," 'Breathing-Adapted Imaging Techniques for Rapid 4-Dimensional Lung Tomosynthesis.PURPOSE: This article presents enhancements to a 4-dimensional (4D) lung digital tomosynthesis (DTS) model introduced in a 2018 paper. That model was proposed as an adjunct to 4D computed tomography (4DCT) to improve tumor localization through artifact reduction achieved by imaging the entire lung in all projections, reducing the projection collection time duration for each phase compared with 4DCT, and requiring only a single-breath cycle to capture all phases. This is applicable to SABR treatment planning. Enhancements comprise customized patient 4D-DTS x-ray scanning parameters. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Imaging parameters derived with the 4D-DTS model were arc duration, frames per second, pulse duration, and tube current normalized to single-chest radiographic milliampere-seconds (mA/mAs(AEC)). Optimized phase-specific DTS projections imaging parameters were derived for volunteer respiration-tracking surrogate waveforms and for sinusoidal waveforms. These parameters are temporally matched to the respiratory surrogate waveform and presented as continuous data plots during a period of 20 seconds. Comparison is made between surrogate excursions during a single-phase CT and 4D-DTS reconstructions. RESULTS: 4D-DTS imaging techniques were customized to volunteer respiratory waveforms and sinusoidal waveforms. Technique settings at the highest velocity portions of the volunteer waveforms were arc duration 0.066 seconds, frame rate 921 Hz, pulse duration 1.076 ms, and normalized tube current 76.2 s(-1). Technique settings at the highest velocity portions of the sinusoidal waveforms were arc duration 0.029 seconds, frame rate 2074 Hz, pulse duration 0.472 ms, and normalized tube current 173.6 s(-1). Sinusoidal surrogate excursion distance at the highest velocity portion of the waveform during a CT rotation of 0.5 seconds ranged from 2.68 to 21.09 mm, all greater than the limiting excursion distance chosen in the 4D-DTS model. CONCLUSIONS: 4D-DTS image technique settings can be customized to individual patient breathing patterns so that captured range of motion satisfies an operator-selected value.',\n"," 'Co-delivery of gemcitabine and paclitaxel plus NanoCpG empowers chemoimmunotherapy of postoperative \"cold\" triple-negative breast cancer.Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) due to lack of clear target and notorious \"cold\" tumor microenvironment (TME) is one of the most intractable and lethal malignancies. Tuning \"cold\" TME into \"hot\" becomes an emerging therapeutic strategy to TNBC. Herewith, we report that integrin-targeting micellar gemcitabine and paclitaxel (ATN-mG/P, ATN sequence: Ac-PhScNK-NH(2)) cooperating with polymersomal CpG (NanoCpG) effectively \"heated up\" and treated TNBC. ATN-mG/P exhibited greatly boosted apoptotic activity in 4T1 cells, induced potent immunogenic cell death (ICD), and efficiently stimulated maturation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs). Remarkably, in a postoperative TNBC model, ATN-mG/P combining with NanoCpG promoted strong anti-cancer immune responses, showing a greatly augmented proportion of mature DCs and CD8(+) T cells while reduced immune-suppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T cells (T(reg)), which led to complete inhibition of lung metastasis and 60% mice tumor-free. The co-delivery of gemcitabine and paclitaxel at desired ratio in combination with NanoCpG provides a unique platform for potent chemoimmunotherapy of \"cold\" tumors like TNBC.',\n"," 'Molecular signaling network and therapeutic developments in breast cancer brain metastasis.Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers in women worldwide. It has surpassed lung cancer as the leading cause of cancer-related death. Breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) is becoming a major clinical concern that is commonly associated with ER-ve and HER2+ve subtypes of BC patients. Metastatic lesions in the brain originate when the cancer cells detach from a primary breast tumor and establish metastatic lesions and infiltrate near and distant organs via systemic blood circulation by traversing the BBB. The colonization of BC cells in the brain involves a complex interplay in the tumor microenvironment (TME), metastatic cells, and brain cells like endothelial cells, microglia, and astrocytes. BCBM is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality and presents a challenge to developing successful cancer therapy. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanism of BCBM and novel therapeutic strategies for patients with brain metastatic BC.',\n"," 'Genotoxicity and maternal-fetal safety of the dried extract of leaves of Azadirachta indica A. Juss (Meliaceae) in Wistar rats.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Azadirachta indica A. Juss (Meliaceae), popularly known as \"neem\", is used for the treatment of rheumatism, cancer, ulcers, diabetes, respiratory problems, among others. This species is present on six continents and contains more than 400 bioactive compounds. Practically all parts of the plant are used in the treatment of diseases. Although it is widely used, no study has evaluated the safety of this species throughout the gestational period in Wistar rats. AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the genotoxicity and the effect of treatment with dried extract of leaves of Azadirachta indica on maternal toxicity and fetal development. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The dried extract of leaves of A. indica was obtained by spray drying after percolation of the plant material in 30% ethanol (w/w). The total flavonoids and rutin contents of the extract were determined by spectrophotometric method and HPLC-DAD, respectively. Pregnant Wistar rats (n\\xa0=\\xa040) were divided into four groups (n\\xa0=\\xa010/group): one control and three groups treated with dried extract of leaves of A. indica at doses of 300, 600 or 1200\\xa0mg/kg. Treatments were carried out from gestational day (GD) 0-20. During gestation, clinical signs of toxicity, weight gain, feed and water consumption of the dams were evaluated. On GD 21, rats were euthanized and cardiac blood was collected. Liver, kidneys, lung, heart, uterus, ovaries and bone marrow were collected. Reproductive performance parameters, histopathological analysis, biochemistry and genotoxicity were evaluated. Fetuses were evaluated for external morphology, skeletal and visceral changes. RESULTS: The total flavonoid content of the extract ranged from 2.64 to 3.01%, and the rutin content was 1.07%. There was no change in body mass gain, food and water consumption between the evaluated groups. There was also no difference between the groups in terms of biochemical parameters, reproductive performance, histopathological analysis of the mother\\'s organs and genotoxicity. Supernumerary ossification sites of the sternum were observed, and other skeletal and visceral alterations were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment did not induce maternal toxicity, it was neither embryotoxic nor fetotoxic. The extract was not potentially genotoxic, and at a dose of 1200\\xa0mg/kg, it caused changes in the ossification of the sternum.',\n"," 'The anti-tumor effects of Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb. and its monomer composition: A review.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb. has been included in \"The Plant List\" (http://www. theplantlist.org) and is the most widely researched species in its genus. It is called Nanshe Teng in China. Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb. is a plant of Euonymus and it\\'s medicinal part is the vine and stem. It is also called Alias Dragon grass, Yellow Yine, etc. It has good anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory and other effects. More and more studies have shown that Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb. has a significant therapeutic effect on a variety of malignant tumors. The research on Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb. has a good application prospect for the development of anti-tumor drugs. However, no systematic reports on Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb. have been published before. AIM OF THE REVIEW: This paper summarizes the metabolic products for anti-tumor and the mechanism for anti-tumor of Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb. to provide reference for further development and research. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The relevant information on Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb. was collected from the scientific databases including PubMed, CNKI, ScienceDirect, Wiley, Springer, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Baidu Scholar, Pharmacopoeia of the People\\'s Republic of China and Flora Republicae Popularis Sinicae, etc. RESULTS: At present, more than 200 compounds have been identified from Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb., including terpenoids, flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, polyketides and benzene derivatives, etc. Pharmacological studies have shown that Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb. has a variety effects of inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, inducing tumor cell apoptosis, inhibiting tumor cells invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis, reversing multi-drug resistance, and also collaborativing Micro RNA to inhibit tumor growth, etc. It has a significant effect on gastric cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer, etc. The extracts of Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb. have been widely used in experiments, and the toxic and side effects are small. CONCLUSIONS: Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb. is rich in chemical constituents, diverse in pharmacological activities and abundant in resources, which is widely used in clinics from traditional to modern.

Curcumae Rhizoma, the main essential oil component of which is curcumol, is widely used for the treatment of phymatosis in China due to its antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antithrombin, anti-tissue fibrosis and anti-oxygen pharmacological activities, but its potential for the treatment of UFs has not been evaluated. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of curcumol intervention in human uterine leiomyoma cells (UMCs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Putative targets of curcumol intervention in UFs were identified using network pharmacology strategies. Molecular docking was performed to assess the binding affinity of curcumol to core targets. A concentration gradient of curcumol (0, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500\\xa0μM) or RU-486 (mifepristone, 0, 10, 20, 40, 50, and 100\\xa0μM) was applied to UMCs, and cell viability was detected by the CCK-8 assay. Cell apoptosis and cell cycle were examined by flow cytometry, and cell migration was assessed by a wound-healing assay. Additionally, the mRNA and protein expression levels of critical pathway components were evaluated by RT‒PCR and western blotting. Finally, the actions of curcumol on different tumor cell lines were summarized. RESULTS: Network pharmacology predicted 62 genes with roles in the treatment of UFs with curcumol, and MAPK14 (p38MAPK) displayed a higher interaction degree. GO enrichment and KEGG analyses revealed that the core genes were abundantly enriched in the MAPK signaling pathway. The molecular binding of curcumol to core targets was relatively stable. In UMCs, 200, 300 and 400\\xa0μM curcumol treatment for 24\\xa0h decreased cell viability compared with that in the control group, and the greatest effect was detected at 48\\xa0h and maintained until 72\\xa0h. Curcumol arrested cells in the G0/G1 phase and subsequently suppressed mitosis, promoted early apoptosis and reduced the degree of wound healing in a concentration-dependent manner in UMCs. Furthermore, 200\\xa0μM curcumol decreased the mRNA and protein expression of p38MAPK, the mRNA expression of NF-κB, and the protein expression of Ki-67 and increased the mRNA and protein expression of Caspase 9. Curcumol (300 and 400\\xa0μM) decreased the mRNA and protein expression of p38MAPK, NF-κB, and Ki-67 and increased the protein expression of Caspase 9 in UMCs. Curcumol was demonstrated to treat tumor cell lines, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer, liver cancer and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, but its effects on benign tumors have not yet been reported. CONCLUSION: Curcumol suppresses cell proliferation and cell migration while arresting the cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase and inducing cell apoptosis in UMCs via a mechanism related to p38MAPK/NF-κB pathway regulation. Curcumol may be a potential therapeutic and preventive agent in the treatment of benign tumors such as UFs.',\n"," 'Female reproductive and hormonal factors and lung cancer mortality among never-smokers: A prospective cohort study of 287\\u2009408 Chinese women.There is growing, but inconsistent evidence suggesting oestrogen may play a key role in lung cancer development, especially among never-smoking women for whom lung cancer risk factors remain largely elusive. Using the China Kadoorie Biobank, a large-scale prospective cohort with 302\\u2009510 women aged 30 to 79\\u2009years recruited from 10 regions in China during 2004 to 2008, we assessed the risk of lung cancer death among self-reported never-smoking women who were cancer-free at baseline, in relation to age at menarche, age at menopause, time since menopause, prior use of oral contraceptives (OCP), number of livebirths, breastfeeding and age at first livebirth. Women were followed up to December 31, 2016 with linkage to mortality data. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using Cox regression, adjusting for key confounders including several socio-demographic, environmental and lifestyle factors. Among 287\\u2009408 never-smoking women, 814 died from lung cancer with a median follow-up of 10.3\\u2009years. Women who had used OCP within 15\\u2009years prior to baseline had a significantly higher hazard of lung cancer death compared with never-users: HR\\xa0=\\xa01.85 (95% CI: 1.14-3.00) and risk increased by 6% with each additional year of use: HR\\xa0=\\xa01.06 (1.01-1.10). Among parous women, the hazard of lung cancer death increased by 13% with each single livebirth: HR\\xa0=\\xa01.13 (1.05-1.23); and among post-menopausal women, the risk increased by 2% with each year since menopause: HR\\xa0=\\xa01.02 (1.01-1.04). These results suggest that reproductive factors which were proxies for lower endogenous oestrogen level, for example, longer duration of OCP use, could play a role in lung cancer development.',\n"," 'STAT3 silencing by an aptamer-based strategy hampers the crosstalk between NSCLC cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts.The identification of new effective therapeutic options for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents a crucial challenge in oncology. Recent studies indicate that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) participate in tumor progression by establishing a favorable microenvironment that promotes cancer progression. Therefore, the development of strategies inhibiting the interplay between CAFs and cancer cells is considered a winning approach for the development of effective anti-cancer drugs. Among other factors, the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) has been reported as a key mediator of CAF oncogenic actions, representing a promising therapeutic target. Here, we applied an aptamer-based conjugate (named Gint4.T-STAT3), containing a STAT3 siRNA linked to an aptamer binding and inhibiting the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)β, to obtain STAT3-specific silencing and interfere with CAF pro-tumorigenic functions. We demonstrated that this molecule effectively delivers the STAT3 siRNA in NSCLC cells, and blocks CAF-induced cancer cell growth and migration and reduced spheroid dimension. In addition, we found that Gint4.T-STAT3 alters CAF phenotype, thus functioning as a double-acting molecule able to inhibit the entire tumor bulk. Our data provide a proof of principle for the targeting of CAF pro-tumor functions through an aptamer-based drug, and can open innovative horizons in NSCLC therapy.',\n"," 'Delivery of anti-microRNA-21 by lung-targeted liposomes for pulmonary fibrosis treatment.Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disorder with a low survival rate. Pulmonary fibrosis is one of the complications of COVID-19 and has a high prevalence in COVID-19 patients. Currently, no effective therapies other than lung transplantation are available to cure IPF and post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that mediate the development and progression of pulmonary fibrosis, thus making them potent drug candidates for this serious disease. MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) promotes not only the differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts but also epithelial-mesenchymal transition, both of which have been proposed as fundamental processes in pulmonary fibrosis development. Delivery of anti-miR-21 to block the miR-21-associated fibrogenic pathways represents a promising therapy for pulmonary fibrosis. However, microRNA treatment is challenged by quick degradation of RNA in blood, poor cellular uptake, and off-target effects. To overcome these challenges, we developed a lung-targeted, cationic liposome formulation to encapsulate anti-miR-21, enhance its delivery efficiency, and improve the therapeutic efficacy. We optimized the liposome formulation and demonstrated the anti-fibrotic effects using both in\\xa0vitro and in\\xa0vivo lung fibrosis models. Our results showed that anti-miR-21 delivered by cationic liposomes suppressed myofibroblast differentiation, reduced the synthesis of extracellular matrix, and inhibited fibrosis progression.',\n"," 'Betulinic acid, a major therapeutic triterpene of Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb., acts as a chemosensitizer of gemcitabine by promoting Chk1 degradation.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb., also called as oriental bittersweet vine or climbing spindle berry, a traditional Chinese herbal medicine has been used to treat a spectrum of painful and inflammatory diseases for centuries. Explored for their unique medicinal properties, C.orbiculatus offers additional therapeutic effects on cancerous diseases. The effect of single-agent gemcitabine on survival has not long been encouraging, combination therapies provide patients multiple chances of benefit for improved clinical response. AIMS OF THIS STUDY: This study aims at expounding the chemopotentiating effects and underlying mechanisms of betulinic acid, a primary therapeutic triterpene of C. orbiculatus in combination with gemcitabine chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The preparation of betulinic acid was optimized using ultrasonic-assisted extraction method. Gemcitabine-resistant cell model was established by induction of the cytidine deaminase. MTT, colony formation, EdU incorporation and Annexin V/PI staining assays were used to evaluate cytotoxicity, cell proliferation and apoptosis in BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cell line and H1299 non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line. Comet assay, metaphase chromosome spread and γH2AX immunostaining were applied for DNA damage assessment. Western blot and co-immunoprecipitation was used to detect the phosphorylation and ubiquitination of Chk1. Mode of action of gemcitabine in combination with betulinic acid was further captured in BxPC-3-derived mouse xenograft model. RESULTS: We noticed that the extraction method had an impact on the thermal stability of C. orbiculatus. Ultrasound-assisted extraction at room temperature in shorter processing time could maximize the overall yields and biological activities of C. orbiculatus. The major constituent was identified as betulinic acid, and the pentacyclic triterpene represented the prominent anticancer activity of C. orbiculatus. Forced expression of cytidine deaminase conferred acquired resistance to gemcitabine, while betulinic acid displayed equivalent cytotoxicity toward gemcitabine-resistant and sensitive cells. A combination therapy of gemcitabine with betulinic acid produced synergistic pharmacologic interaction on cell viability, apoptosis and DNA double-strand breaks. Moreover, betulinic acid abrogated gemcitabine-triggered Chk1 activation by destabilizing Chk1 loading via proteasomal degradation. The combination of gemcitabine and betulinic acid significantly retarded BxPC-3 tumor growth in vivo compared to single-agent gemcitabine treatment alone, accompanied with reduced Chk1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence that betulinic acid is a potential candidate for chemosensitization as a naturally occurring Chk1 inhibitor and warrants further preclinical evaluation.',\n"," 'Phagocytosis increases an oxidative metabolic and immune suppressive signature in tumor macrophages.Phagocytosis is a key macrophage function, but how phagocytosis shapes tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) phenotypes and heterogeneity in solid tumors remains unclear. Here, we utilized both syngeneic and novel autochthonous lung tumor models in which neoplastic cells express the fluorophore tdTomato (tdTom) to identify TAMs that have phagocytosed neoplastic cells in vivo. Phagocytic tdTompos TAMs upregulated antigen presentation and anti-inflammatory proteins, but downregulated classic proinflammatory effectors compared to tdTomneg TAMs. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling identified TAM subset-specific and common gene expression changes associated with phagocytosis. We uncover a phagocytic signature that is predominated by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), ribosomal, and metabolic genes, and this signature correlates with worse clinical outcome in human lung cancer. Expression of OXPHOS proteins, mitochondrial content, and functional utilization of OXPHOS were increased in tdTompos TAMs. tdTompos tumor dendritic cells also display similar metabolic changes. Our identification of phagocytic TAMs as a distinct myeloid cell state links phagocytosis of neoplastic cells in vivo with OXPHOS and tumor-promoting phenotypes.',\n"," 'CCL5-producing migratory dendritic cells guide CCR5+ monocytes into the draining lymph nodes.Dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes capture, transport, and present antigen to cognate T cells in the draining lymph nodes (LNs) in a CCR7-dependent manner. Since only migratory DCs express this chemokine receptor, it is unclear how monocytes reach the LN. In steady-state and following inhalation of several PAMPs, scRNA-seq identified LN mononuclear phagocytes as monocytes, resident, or migratory type 1 and type 2 conventional (c)DCs, despite the downregulation of Xcr1, Clec9a, H2-Ab1, Sirpa, and Clec10a transcripts on migratory cDCs. Migratory cDCs, however, upregulated Ccr7, Ccl17, Ccl22, and Ccl5. Migratory monocytes expressed Ccr5, a high-affinity receptor for Ccl5. Using two tracking methods, we observed that both CD88hiCD26lomonocytes and CD88-CD26hi cDCs captured inhaled antigens in the lung and migrated to LNs. Antigen exposure in mixed-chimeric Ccl5-, Ccr2-, Ccr5-, Ccr7-, and Batf3-deficient mice demonstrated that while antigen-bearing DCs use CCR7 to reach the LN, monocytes use CCR5 to follow CCL5-secreting migratory cDCs into the LN, where they regulate DC-mediated immunity.',\n"," 'Spatial mapping reveals granuloma diversity and histopathological superstructure in human tuberculosis.The hallmark of tuberculosis (TB) is the formation of immune cell-enriched aggregates called granulomas. While granulomas are pathologically diverse, their tissue-wide heterogeneity has not been spatially resolved at the single-cell level in human tissues. By spatially mapping individual immune cells in every lesion across entire tissue sections, we report that in addition to necrotizing granulomas, the human TB lung contains abundant non-necrotizing leukocyte aggregates surrounding areas of necrotizing tissue. These cellular lesions were more diverse in composition than necrotizing lesions and could be stratified into four general classes based on cellular composition and spatial distribution of B cells and macrophages. The cellular composition of non-necrotizing structures also correlates with their proximity to necrotizing lesions, indicating these are foci of distinct immune reactions adjacent to necrotizing granulomas. Together, we show that during TB, diseased lung tissue develops a histopathological superstructure comprising at least four different types of non-necrotizing cellular aggregates organized as satellites of necrotizing granulomas.',\n"," 'Acetylation regulates the nucleocytoplasmic distribution and oncogenic function of karyopherin alpha 2 in lung adenocarcinoma.Karyopherin subunit alpha 2 (KPNA2, importin α1) is a nucleoplasmic protein responsible for the nuclear import of proteins with classical nuclear localization signals. Aberrant nuclear accumulation of KPNA2 has been observed in numerous cancer tissues. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is involved in the phosphorylation and acetylation of KPNA2 in enterocytes. However, the impact of these post-translational modifications on modulating the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of KPNA2 and its oncogenic role remain unclear. Unlike nuclear accumulation of wild-type KPNA2, which promoted lung cancer cell migration, KPNA2 Lys22 acetylation-mimicking mutations (K22Q and K22Q/S105A) prevented nuclear localization of KPNA2 and reduced the cell migration ability. Cytosolic KPNA2 K22Q interacted with and restricted the nuclear entry of E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1), an oncogenic cargo protein of KPNA2, in lung cancer cells. Intriguingly, the AMPK activator EX229 promoted the nuclear export of KPNA2 S105A. However, the CBP/p300 inhibitor CCS-1477 abolished this phenomenon, suggesting that CBP/p300-mediated acetylation of KPNA2 promoted KPNA2 nuclear export in lung cancer cells. Collectively, our findings suggest that the CBP/p300 positively regulates KPNA2 acetylation, which enhances its cytosolic localization and suppresses its oncogenic activity in lung cancer.',\n"," 'Thioredoxin facilitates hepatocellular carcinoma stemness and metastasis by increasing BACH1 stability to activate the AKT/mTOR pathway.Thioredoxin (TXN) is essential for preserving balance and controlling the intracellular redox state. Most studies have focused on the function of TXN in redox reactions, which is critical for tumor progression. Here, we showed that TXN promotes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) stemness properties in a non-redox-dependent manner, which has rarely been reported in previous studies. TXN exhibited upregulated expression in human HCC specimens, which was associated with a poor prognosis. Functional studies showed that TXN promoted HCC stemness properties and facilitated HCC metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, TXN promoted the stemness of HCC cells by interacting with BTB and CNC homology 1 (BACH1) and stabilized BACH1 expression by inhibiting its ubiquitination. BACH1 was positively correlated with TXN expression and was significantly upregulated in HCC. In addition, BACH1 promotes HCC stemness by activating the AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Furthermore, we found that the specific inhibition of TXN in combination with lenvatinib in mice significantly improved the treatment of metastatic HCC. In summary, our data demonstrate that TXN plays a crucial role in HCC stemness and BACH1 plays an integral part in regulating this process by activating the AKT/mTOR pathway. Thus, TXN is a promising target for metastatic HCC therapy.',\n"," 'COVID-19 Lung Disease: Lessons Learned.nan',\n"," 'Concurrent induction of apoptosis and necroptosis in\\xa0apigenin‑treated malignant mesothelioma cells: Reversal of\\xa0Warburg effect through Akt inhibition and p53 upregulation.A high dependence on aerobic glycolysis, known as the Warburg effect, is one of the metabolic features exhibited by tumor cells. Therefore, targeting glycolysis is becoming a very promising strategy for the development of anticancer drugs. In the present study, it was investigated whether pre‑adaptation of malignant mesothelioma (MM) cells to an acidic environment was associated with a metabolic shift to the Warburg phenotype in energy production, and whether apigenin targets acidosis‑driven metabolic reprogramming. Cell viability, glycolytic activity, Annexin V‑PE binding activity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP content, western blot analysis and spheroid viability were assessed in the present study. MM cells pre‑adapted to lactic acid were resistant to the anticancer drug gemcitabine, increased Akt activation, downregulated p53 expression, and upregulated rate‑limiting enzymes in glucose metabolism compared with their parental cells. Apigenin treatment increased cytotoxicity, Akt inactivation and p53 upregulation. Apigenin also reduced glucose uptake along with downregulation of key regulatory enzymes in glycolysis, increased ROS levels with loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and downregulated the levels of complexes I, III and IV in the mitochondrial electron transport chain with intracellular ATP depletion, resulting in upregulation of molecules mediating apoptosis and necroptosis. Apigenin‑induced alterations of cellular responses were similar to those of Akt inactivation by Ly294002. Overall, the present results provide mechanistic evidence supporting the anti‑glycolytic and cytotoxic role of apigenin via inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and p53 upregulation.',\n"," 'Fuzheng Kang-Ai inhibits NSCLC cell proliferation via regulating hsa_circ_0048091/hsa-miR-378g/ARRDC3 pathway.BACKGROUND: Current treatments for lung cancer have their own deficiencies, such as severe adverse effect. Therefore, more safe and effective drugs are needed. PURPOSE: Fuzheng Kang-Ai (FZKA for short) has been applied as an adjuvant\\xa0treatment in advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients for decades in China, showing a definitive effect with minimal toxicities. However, the underlying mechanism is yet to be identified. STUDY DESIGN: Both in vitro and in vivo experiments were performed in this study to identify the exact mechanism by which FZKA inhibits NSCLC cell proliferation. METHODS: MTT and CCK-8 assays were used to detect cell viability. Xenograft model was performed for in vivo experiments. CircRNA and miRNA sequencing were used to find the differentially expressed circRNAs and miRNAs, respectively. qRT-PCR was performed to check the expression levels of circRNA, miRNA and mRNA. BaseScope was carried out to observe the expression of circRNA in situ. Actinomycin D and RNase R experiments were done to show the stability of circRNA. Nuclear-cytoplasmic fractionation and FISH were used to identify the localization of circRNA and miRNA. Pull-down, RIP, and luciferase activity assays were performed to show the biding ability of circRNA, miRNA and target proteins. Flow cytometry was done to observe cell apoptosis. Western blot and IHC were done to detect the protein expression. TCGA database was used to analyze the survival rate. RESULTS: FZKA inhibits NSCLC cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Hsa_circ_0048091 and hsa-miR-378g were the most differentially expressed circRNA and miRNA, respectively, after FZKA treatment. Silencing hsa_circ_0048091 and overexpressing hsa-miR-378g promoted cell proliferation and reversed the inhibition effect of FZKA on NSCLC, respectively. Hsa-miR-378g was sponged by hsa_circ_0048091, and the overexpression of miR-378g reversed the inhibition effect of hsa_ circ_0048091 on NSCLC. ARRDC3, as a target of hsa-miR-378g, was increased by FZKA treatment. Silencing ARRDC3 reversed both the inhibition effect of FZKA and miR-378g inhibitor on NSCLC. CONCLUSION: This study, for the first time, has established the function of hsa_circ_0048091, hsa- miR-378g, and ARRDC3 in lung cancer. It also shows that FZKA inhibits NSCLC cell proliferation through hsa_circ_0048091/hsa-miR-378g/ARRDC3 pathway, uncovering a novel mechanism by which FZKA controls human NSCLC cell growth.',\n"," 'Panax notoginseng saponins normalises tumour blood vessels by inhibiting EphA2 gene expression to modulate the tumour microenvironment of breast cancer.BACKGROUND: Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS), the main active component of Panax notoginseng, can promote vascular microcirculation. PNS exhibits antitumor effects in various cancers. However, the molecular basis of the relationship between PNS and tumor blood vessels remains unclear. PURPOSE: To study the relationship between PNS inhibiting the growth and metastasis of breast cancer and promoting the normalization of blood vessels. METHODS: We performed laser speckle imaging of tumor microvessels and observed the effects of PNS on tumor growth and metastasis of MMTV-PyMT (FVB) spontaneous breast cancer in a transgenic mouse model. Immunohistochemical staining of Ki67 and CD31 was performed for tumors, scanning electron microscopy was used to observe tumor vascular morphology, and flow cytometry was used to detect tumor tissue immune microenvironment (TME). RNA-seq analysis was performed using the main vessels of the tumor tissues of the mice. HUVECs were cultured in tumor supernatant in vitro to simulate tumor microenvironment and verify the sequencing differential key genes. RESULTS: After treatment with PNS, we observed that tumor growth was suppressed, the blood perfusion of the systemic tumor microvessels in the mice increased, and the number of lung metastases decreased. Moreover, the vascular density of the primary tumor increased, and the vascular epidermis was smoother and flatter. Moreover, the number of tumor-associated macrophages in the tumor microenvironment was reduced, and the expression levels of IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α were reduced in the tumor tissues. PNS downregulated the expression of multiple genes associated with tumor angiogenesis, migration, and adhesion. In vitro tubule formation experiments revealed that PNS promoted the formation and connection of tumor blood vessels and normalized the vessel morphology primarily by inhibiting EphA2 expression. In addition, PNS inhibited the expression of tumor vascular marker proteins and vascular migration adhesion-related proteins in vivo. CONCLUSION: In this study, we found that PNS promoted the generation and connection of tumor vascular endothelial cells, revealing the key role of EphA2 in endothelial cell adhesion and tumor blood vessel morphology. PNS can inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of breast cancer by inhibiting EphA2, improving the immune microenvironment of breast cancer and promoting the normalization of tumor blood vessels.',\n"," 'Novel 4-Amino-Quinazoline moieties ligated Platinum(IV) prodrugs overcome cisplatin resistance in EGFR(WT) human lung cancer.Developing bioactive axial ligands ligated platinum(IV) complexes with advantages over monotherapy and drug combinations is an efficient strategy to ameliorate the clinical defects of platinum(II) drugs. In this article, a series of 4-amino-quinazoline moieties (privileged pharmacophores of well-studied EGFR inhhibitors) ligated platinum(IV) were synthesized and evaluated for their anticancer activities. Among the complex, 17b demonstrated higher cytotoxicity against the tested lung cancer cells (including CDDP-resistant A549/CDDP cells) while lower cytotoxicity toward human normal cells than Oxaliplatin (Oxa) or cisplatin (CDDP). Mechanistic investigation demonstrated that the enhanced intracellular uptake of 17b efficiently elevated the of reactive oxygen species levels by 6.1 times more than Oxa. Detailed mechanisms of overcoming CDDP resistance revealed that 17b significantly induced apoptosis via inducing severe DNA damage, disturbing mitochondrial transmembrane potentials, efficiently disturbing EGFR-PI3K-Akt signaling transduction and activating a mitochondria-dependent apoptosis pathway. Besides, 17b significantly inhibited migration and invasion in A549/CDDP cells. In vivo tests exhibited that 17b obtained superior antitumor effect and attenuated systemic toxicity in A549/CDDP xenografts. All these results emphasized that the antitumor action of 17b differed from that of. classical platinum(II) drugs and provided a novel practical method to overcome CDDP resistance in lung cancer.',\n"," 'LncRNA DGUOK-AS1 facilitates non-small cell lung cancer growth and metastasis through increasing TRPM7 stability via m6A modification.BACKGROUND: N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification plays key roles in tumor progression. LncRNA deoxyguanosine kinase antisense RNA 1 (DGUOK-AS1) has been reported as a promoter in tumors, but its role and mechanism in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) development remain uncertain. METHODS: Cell proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis were investigated via CCK-8, colony formation, transwell, and tube formation assays, respectively. The location of DGUOK-AS1 was detected via FISH assay. The interaction relationship among DGUOK-AS1, IGF2BP2 and TRPM7 was confirmed by RIP and MeRIP assays. The effects of DGUOK-AS1 on NSCLC growth and metastasis in vivo were investigated using xenograft and pulmonary metastatic models. RESULTS: DGUOK-AS1 was upregulated in NSCLC. DGUOK-AS1 silencing inhibited NSCLC cell proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis. DGUOK-AS1 was mostly expressed in cytoplasm, and positively regulated IGF2BP2. METTL3/IGF2BP2 axis could increase TRPM7 mRNA stability in m6A-dependent manner. TRPM7 overexpression reversed the inhibitive function of DGUOK-AS1 silencing on NSCLC development. DGUOK-AS1 knockdown suppressed NSCLC cell growth and metastasis in nude mice. CONCLUSION: DGUOK-AS1 silencing restrains NSCLC cell growth and metastasis through decreasing TRPM7 stability via regulation of the METTL3/IGF2BP2-mediated m6A modification.',\n"," 'Astragaloside IV targets PRDX6, inhibits the activation of RAC subunit in NADPH oxidase 2 for oxidative damage.BACKGROUND: Radix Astragali Mongolici, as a traditional Chinese medicine, is widely used in the treatment of qi deficiency, viral or bacterial infection, inflammation and cancer. Astragaloside IV (AST), a key active compound in Radix Astragali Mongolici, has been shown to reduce disease progression by inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammation. However, the specific target and mechanism of action of AST in improving oxidative stress are still unclear. PURPOSE: This study aims to explore the target and mechanism of AST to improve oxidative stress, and to explain the biological process of oxidative stress. METHODS: AST functional probes were designed to capture target proteins and combined with protein spectrum to analyze target proteins. Small molecule and protein interaction technologies were used to verify the mode of action, while computer dynamics simulation technology was used to analyze the site of interaction with the target protein. The pharmacological activity of AST in improving oxidative stress was evaluated in a mouse model of acute lung injury induced by LPS. Additionally, pharmacological and serial molecular biological approaches were used to explore the underlying mechanism of action. RESULTS: AST inhibits PLA2 activity in PRDX6 by targeting the PLA2 catalytic triad pocket. This binding alters the conformation and structural stability of PRDX6 and interferes with the interaction between PRDX6 and RAC, hindering the activation of the RAC-GDI heterodimer. Inactivation of RAC prevents NOX2 maturation, attenuates superoxide anion production, and improves oxidative stress damage. CONCLUSION: The findings of this research indicate that AST impedes PLA2 activity by acting on the catalytic triad of PRDX6. This, in turn, disrupts the interaction between PRDX6 and RAC, thereby hindering the maturation of NOX2 and diminishing the oxidative stress damage.',\n"," 'Berberine attenuates epithelial mesenchymal transition in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice via activating A(2a)R and mitigating the SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling.AIMS: Berberine is endowed with anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects. This study explored the role of adenosine A(2a) receptor (A(2a)R) activation and SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling suppression in the protective effects of berberine in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. MAIN METHODS: Pulmonary fibrosis was generated in mice by injecting bleomycin (40\\xa0U/kg, i.p.) on days 0, 3, 7, 10 and 14. Mice were treated with berberine (5\\xa0mg/kg, i.p.) from day 15 to day 28. KEY FINDINGS: Severe lung fibrosis and increased collagen content were observed in the bleomycin-challenged mice. Pulmonary A(2a)R downregulation was documented in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis animals and was accompanied by enhanced expression of SDF-1/CXCR4. Moreover, TGF-β1elevation and pSmad2/3 overexpression were reported in parallel with enhanced epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers expression, vimentin and α-SMA. Besides, bleomycin significantly elevated the inflammatory and pro-fibrogenic mediator NF-κB p65, TNF-α and IL-6. Furthermore, bleomycin administration induced oxidative stress as depicted by decreased Nrf2, SOD, GSH and catalase levels. Interestingly, berberine administration markedly ameliorated the fibrotic changes in lungs by modulating the purinergic system through the inhibition of A(2a)R downregulation, mitigating EMT and effectively suppressing inflammation and oxidative stress. Strikingly, A(2a)R blockade by SCH 58261, impeded the pulmonary protective effect of berberine. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings indicated that berberine could attenuate the pathological processes of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis at least partially via upregulating A(2a)R and mitigating the SDF-1/CXCR4 related pathway, suggesting A(2a)R as a potential therapeutic target for the management of pulmonary fibrosis.',\n"," 'The Ethyl acetate extract from Celastrus orbiculatus suppresses non-small-cell lung cancer by activating Hippo signaling and inhibiting YAP nuclear translocation.BACKGROUND: Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb. is a medicinal plant that has been widely used for thousands of years in China, and the ethyl acetate extract (Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb. Extract, COE) from its stem was reported to exert antitumor and anti-inflammatory effects in various preclinical studies. However, the anti-non-small-cell lung cancer activity of COE and its potential mechanism are not yet fully understood. PURPOSE: To investigate the antitumor effects of COE on non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and explore its molecular mechanism from the perspective of Hippo signaling, YAP nuclear translocation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. METHODS: The effects of COE on proliferation, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, stemness, and senescence in NSCLC cell lines were determined by CCK-8, clone formation, flow cytometry, and β-galactosidase staining assays. The effects of COE on Hippo signaling were investigated by Western blotting. The intracellular expression and distribution of YAP were analyzed by immunofluorescence assay. DCFH-DA probe combined with flow cytometry was used to detect intracellular total ROS levels in NSCLC cells after COE treatment. Xenograft tumor model was established, and the animal living image system was employed to analyze the effects of COE on the Hippo-YAP signaling in vivo. RESULT: COE significantly inhibited NSCLC activity in vitro and in vivo, mainly by proliferation inhibition, cycle arrest, apoptosis promotion, senescence promotion, and stemness downregulation. COE strongly activated Hippo signaling and inhibited YAP expression and nuclear retention. Activation of Hippo signaling induced by COE was associated with ROS-mediated phosphorylation of MOB1. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that COE inhibited NSCLC through activating Hippo signaling and suppressing YAP nuclear translocation, in which ROS may play a role in the phosphorylation of the MOB1 protein.',\n"," 'CAMSAP3 negatively regulates lung cancer cell invasion and angiogenesis through nucleolin/HIF-1α mRNA complex stabilization.AIMS: Cancer metastasis is a major cause of lung cancer-related mortality, so identification of related molecular mechanisms is of interest. Calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated protein 3 (CAMSAP3) has been implicated in lung cancer malignancies; however, its role in metastatic processes, including invasion and angiogenesis, is largely unknown. MAIN METHOD: The clinical relevance of CAMSAP3 expression in lung cancer was evaluated. The relevance of CAMSAP3 expression to in vitro cell invasion and angiogenesis was assessed in human lung cancer cells and endothelial cells, respectively. The molecular mechanism was identified by qRT-PCR, immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, and RNA immunoprecipitation. The in vivo metastatic and angiogenic activities of lung cancer cells were assessed. KEY FINDINGS: Low CAMSAP3 expression was found in malignant lung tissues and strongly correlated with a poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). CAMSAP3-knockout NSCLC exhibited high invasive ability, and CAMSAP3 knockout induced HUVEC proliferation and tube formation; these effects were significantly attenuated by reintroduction of exogenous wild-type CAMSAP3. Mechanistically, in the absence of CAMSAP3, the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) was upregulated, which increased the levels of downstream HIF-1α targets such as vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 2 and 9. Proteomic analysis revealed that nucleolin (NCL) bound to CAMSAP3 to regulate HIF-1α mRNA stabilization. In addition, CAMSAP3-knockout lung cancer cells displayed highly aggressive behavior in metastasis and angiogenesis in vivo. SIGNIFICANCE: This study reveals that CAMSAP3 plays a negative regulatory role in lung cancer cell metastatic behavior both in vitro and in vivo through NCL/HIF-1α mRNA complex stabilization.',\n"," 'Antitumor activity and mechanisms of dual EGFR/DNA-targeting strategy for the treatment of lung cancer with EGFR(L858R/T790M) mutation.Dual inhibitor resistance and circumvent many disadvantages of combination therapy. In this work, fifteen 4-anilinoquinazoline derivatives bearing nitrogen mustard or hemi mustard moieties were designed and synthesized as dual EGFR-DNA targeting anticancer agents. Structures of target molecules were confirmed by (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and HR-MS, and evaluated for their in vitro anti-proliferative activities using MTT assay. Compound 6g emerged as the most potent derivative against mutant-type H1975 cells with IC(50) value of 1.45\\xa0μM, which exhibited 4-fold stronger potency than Chl/Gef (equimolar combination of chlorambucil and gefitinib). Kinase inhibition studies indicated that 6g showed excellent inhibitory effect on EGFR(L858R/T790M) enzyme, which was 8.6 times more effective than gefitinib. Mechanistic studies indicated that 6g induced apoptosis of H1975 cells in a dose-dependent manner and caused DNA damage. Importantly, 6g could significantly inhibit the expression of p-EGFR and its downstream p-AKT and p-ERK in H1975 cells. Molecular docking was also performed to gain insights into the ligand-binding interactions of 6g inside EGFR(WT) and EGFR(L858R/T790M) binding sites. Moreover, 6g efficiently inhibited tumor growth in the H1975 xenograft model without side effects.',\n"," 'PYCR1 promotes the malignant progression of lung cancer through the JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway via PRODH-dependent glutamine synthesize.BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is a serious threat to human life. It is of great significance to elucidate the pathogenesis of lung cancer and search for new markers. This study evaluate the clinical value of pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1 (PYCR1) and explore its role and mechanisms in the malignant progression of lung cancer. METHODS: PYCR1 expression and its relationship with prognosis were analyzed using a bioinformatics database. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunohistochemistry were utilized to examine the expression of PYCR1 in lung cancer tissues and peripheral blood. PYCR1-overexpressing lung cancer cells were constructed, then the cell proliferative, migration, and invasion ability was examined by the MTT and Transwell assays. siRNA against PRODH and STAT3 inhibitor sttatic was used to further elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Luciferase and CHIP assays were carried out for validate the how PYCR1 regulated PD-L1 expression via STAT3. Xenograft experiment was performed to determine the role of PYCR1 in vivo. RESULTS: Database analysis showed that PYCR1 expression was significantly increased in lung cancer tissues, and its high expression predicted poor prognosis. Lung cancer tissue and peripheral blood of patients showed obviously increased PYCR1 expression, and the sensitivity and specificity of serum PYCR1 in the diagnosis of lung cancer were 75.7% and 60%, respectively. PYCR1 overexpression enhanced the proliferative, migration, and invasion abilities of lung cancer cells. Both PRODH silence and stattic effectively attenuated the function of PYCR1. Animal experiment and IHC data indicated that PYCR1 could activated STAT3 phosphorylation and PD-L1, as well as suppressed T cell infiltration in lung cancer. Finally, we also validated that PYCR1 promoted PD-L1 transcription by elevating STAT3 binding to the gene promoter. CONCLUSION: PYCR1 has certain value in the diagnosis and prognosis of lung cancer. Moreover, through regulating JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway, PYCR1 significantly participated in process of lung cancer progression via the metabolism link between proline and glutamine, indicating that PYCR1 might be also a novel therapeutic target.',\n"," 'Exploration of novel dihydroquinoxalinone derivatives as EGFR(L858R/T790M) tyrosine kinase inhibitors for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer.To overcome or delay the drug-resistance of first-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitors and non-selectivity toxicity mediated by second-generation inhibitors, splicing principle was employed to design and synthesize a series of Osimertinib derivatives containing dihydroquinoxalinone (8-30) as the novel third-generation inhibitors against double mutant L858R/T790M in EGFR. Among them, compound 29 showed excellent kinase inhibitory activity against EGFR(L858R/T790M) with an IC(50) value of 0.55\\xa0±\\xa00.02\\xa0nM and potent anti-proliferative activity against H1975 cells with an IC(50) value of 5.88\\xa0±\\xa00.07\\xa0nM. Moreover, the strong down-regulation effect of EGFR-mediated signaling pathways and the promotion of apoptosis in H1975 cells confirmed its potent antitumor activities. Compound 29 was also demonstrated with good ADME profile in various in vitro assays. Further in vivo studies confirmed that compound 29 could suppress the growth of xenograft tumors. These results verified that compound 29 would be a promising lead compound for targeting drug-resistant EGFR mutations.',\n"," 'Glycyrrhetinic acid suppresses breast cancer metastasis by inhibiting M2-like macrophage polarization via activating JNK1/2 signaling.BACKGROUND: Breast cancer metastasis is leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have been considered as potential targets for treating breast cancer metastasis because they promote tumor growth and development. Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) is one of the most important phytochemicals of licorice which has shown promising anti-cancer efficacies in pre-clinical trials. However, the regulatory effect of GA on the polarization of TAMs remains elusive. PURPOSE: To investigate the role of GA in regulating the polarization of M2 macrophages and inhibiting breast cancer metastasis, and to further explore its underlying mechanisms of action. STUDY DESIGN: IL-4 / IL-13-treated RAW 264.7 and THP-1 cells were used as the M2-polarized macrophages in vitro. A 4T1 mouse breast cancer model and the tail vein breast cancer metastasis model were applied to study the effect of GA on breast cancer growth and metastasis in vivo. RESULTS: In vitro studies showed that GA significantly inhibited IL-4 / IL 13-induced M2-like polarization in RAW 264.7 and THP-1 macrophages without affecting M1-like polarization. GA strongly decreased the expression of M2 macrophage markers CD206 and Arg-1, and reduced the levels of the pro-angiogenic molecules VEGF, MMP9, MMP2 and IL-10 in M2 macrophages. GA also increased the phosphorylation of JNK1/2 in M2 macrophages. Moreover, GA significantly suppressed M2 macrophage-induced cell proliferation and migration in 4T1 cancer cells and HUVECs. Interestingly, the inhibitory effects of GA on M2 macrophages were abolished by a JNK inhibitor. Animal studies showed that GA significantly suppressed tumor growth, angiogenesis, and lung metastasis in BALB/c mice bearing breast tumor. In tumor tissues, GA reduced the number of M2 macrophages but elevated the proportion of M1 macrophages, accompanied by activation of JNK signaling. Similar results were found in the tail vein breast cancer metastasis model. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated for the first time that GA could effectively suppress breast cancer growth and metastasis by inhibiting macrophage M2 polarization via activating JNK1/2 signaling. These findings indicate that GA could be served as the lead compound for the future development of anti-breast cancer drug.',\n"," 'MTHFD1L confers a poor prognosis and malignant phenotype in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by activating the ERK5 signaling pathway.MTHFD1L, a key enzyme of folate metabolism, is seldom reported in cancer. In this study, we investigate the role of MTHFD1L in the tumorigenicity of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). ESCC tissue microarrays (TMAs) containing 177 samples from 109 patients were utilized to evaluate whether MTHFD1L expression, determined using immunohistochemical analysis, is a prognostic indicator for ESCC patients. The function of MTHFD1L in the migration and invasion of ESCC cells was studied with wound healing, Transwell, and three-dimensional spheroid invasion assays in vitro and a lung metastasis mouse model in vivo. The mRNA microarrays and Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) were used to explore the downstream of MTHFD1L. Elevated expression of MTHFD1L in ESCC tissues was significantly associated with poor differentiation and prognosis. These phenotypic assays revealed that MTHFD1L significantly promote the viability and metastasis of ESCC cell in vivo and in vitro. Further detailed analyses of the molecular mechanism demonstrated that the ESCC progression driven by MTHFD1L was through up-regulation ERK5 signaling pathways. These findings reveal that MTHFD1L is positively associated with the aggressive phenotype of ESCC by activating ERK5 signaling pathways, suggesting that MTHFD1L is a new biomarker and a potential molecular therapeutic target for ESCC.',\n"," 'HOXD9 contributes to the Warburg effect and tumor metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer via transcriptional activation of PFKFB3.Warburg effect is associated with the progression of various tumors, leading to the development of drugs targeting the phenomenon. PFKFB3 is an isoform of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (PFK2) that modulates the Warburg effect and has been implicated in most common types of cancer, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the mechanisms underlying the upstream regulation of PFKFB3 in NSCLC remain poorly understood. This study reported that the transcription factor HOXD9 is upregulated in NSCLC patient samples relative to adjacent normal tissue. Elevated HOXD9 levels are primarily associated with poor prognosis in patients with NSCLC. Functionally, HOXD9 knockdown impaired the metastatic capacity of NSCLC cells, whereas its over-expression accelerated the metastasis and invasion of NSCLC cells in an orthotopic tumor mouse model. In addition, HOXD9 promoted metastasis by increasing cellular glycolysis. Further mechanistic studies revealed that HOXD9 directly binds to the promoter region of PFKFB3 to enhance its transcription. The recovery assay confirmed that the capability of HOXD9 to promote NSCLC cells metastasis was significantly weakened upon PFKFB3 inhibition. These data suggest that HOXD9 may exert as a novel biomarker in NSCLC, indicating that blocking the HOXD9/PFKFB3 axis may be a potential therapeutic strategy for NSCLC treatment.',\n"," 'Sinomenine hydrochloride bidirectionally inhibits progression of tumor and autoimmune diseases by regulating AMPK pathway.BACKGROUND: Chronic diseases such as tumors and autoimmune disorders are closely linked to metabolism and immunity and require conflicting treatment methods. AMPK can regulate cell growth and inflammation through energy metabolism. Sinomenine is a compound extracted from the traditional Chinese herb sinomenium acutum (Thunb.) Rehd. et Wils. It has been used to treat NSCLC (non-small-cell lung cancer) and RA (rheumatoid arthritis) in some studies, but with limited understanding of its mechanisms. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the inhibitory effect of sinomenine hydrochloride (SH) on NSCLC and RA and to understand the underlying joint mechanisms. RESULTS: The results indicate that SH has a cytotoxic effect specifically on tumor cells, but not on normal cells. SH was found to induce cell apoptosis by activating the AMPK-mTOR pathway. Additionally, in autoimmune disease cell models, SH was shown to reduce the growth of RA-FLS cells by inhibiting the phosphorylation of AMPK, while having no effect on normal macrophages. Moreover, in vivo studies also showed that SH could reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 and slow the development of adjuvant arthritis in rats. Furthermore, SH was found to significantly suppress tumor growth in a tumor xenograft experiment in mice. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new insights into the treatment of tumors and autoimmune diseases by demonstrating that SH can selectively inhibit the growth of NSCLC cells and the progression of RA through activation of the AMPK pathway.',\n"," \"Predicting gene and protein expression levels from DNA and protein sequences with Perceiver.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The functions of an organism and its biological processes result from the expression of genes and proteins. Therefore quantifying and predicting mRNA and protein levels is a crucial aspect of scientific research. Concerning the prediction of mRNA levels, the available approaches use the sequence upstream and downstream of the Transcription Start Site (TSS) as input to neural networks. The State-of-the-art models (e.g., Xpresso and Basenjii) predict mRNA levels exploiting Convolutional (CNN) or Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Networks. However, CNN prediction depends on convolutional kernel size, and LSTM suffers from capturing long-range dependencies in the sequence. Concerning the prediction of protein levels, as far as we know, there is no model for predicting protein levels by exploiting the gene or protein sequences. METHODS: Here, we exploit a new model type (called Perceiver) for mRNA and protein level prediction, exploiting a Transformer-based architecture with an attention module to attend to long-range interactions in the sequences. In addition, the Perceiver model overcomes the quadratic complexity of the standard Transformer architectures. This work's contributions are 1. DNAPerceiver model to predict mRNA levels from the sequence upstream and downstream of the TSS; 2. ProteinPerceiver model to predict protein levels from the protein sequence; 3. Protein&DNAPerceiver model to predict protein levels from TSS and protein sequences. RESULTS: The models are evaluated on cell lines, mice, glioblastoma, and lung cancer tissues. The results show the effectiveness of the Perceiver-type models in predicting mRNA and protein levels. CONCLUSIONS: This paper presents a Perceiver architecture for mRNA and protein level prediction. In the future, inserting regulatory and epigenetic information into the model could improve mRNA and protein level predictions.

Taking surrounding anatomy into account is likely to improve the diagnostic accuracy of artificial intelligence and bring its performance closer to that of a radiologist. Therefore, we aimed to develop a deep convolutional neural network for efficient automatic anatomy segmentation of bedside CXRs. METHODS: To improve the efficiency of the segmentation process, we introduced a \"human-in-the-loop\" segmentation workflow with an active learning approach, looking at five major anatomical structures in the chest (heart, lungs, mediastinum, trachea, and clavicles). This allowed us to decrease the time needed for segmentation by 32% and select the most complex cases to utilize human expert annotators efficiently. After annotation of 2,000 CXRs from different Level 1 medical centers at Charité - University Hospital Berlin, there was no relevant improvement in model performance, and the annotation process was stopped. A 5-layer U-ResNet was trained for 150 epochs using a combined soft Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and cross-entropy as a loss function. DSC, Jaccard index (JI), Hausdorff distance (HD) in mm, and average symmetric surface distance (ASSD) in mm were used to assess model performance. External validation was performed using an independent external test dataset from Aachen University Hospital (n\\xa0=\\xa020). RESULTS: The final training, validation, and testing dataset consisted of 1900/50/50 segmentation masks for each anatomical structure. Our model achieved a mean DSC/JI/HD/ASSD of 0.93/0.88/32.1/5.8 for the lung, 0.92/0.86/21.65/4.85 for the mediastinum, 0.91/0.84/11.83/1.35 for the clavicles, 0.9/0.85/9.6/2.19 for the trachea, and 0.88/0.8/31.74/8.73 for the heart. Validation using the external dataset showed an overall robust performance of our algorithm. CONCLUSIONS: Using an efficient computer-aided segmentation method with active learning, our anatomy-based model achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art approaches. Instead of only segmenting the non-overlapping portions of the organs, as previous studies did, a closer approximation to actual anatomy is achieved by segmenting along the natural anatomical borders. This novel anatomy approach could be useful for developing pathology models for accurate and quantifiable diagnosis.',\n"," 'Lifespan and medical expenditure prognosis for cancer metastasis modeling using semi-Markov process.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: A key reason of high mortality of cancers is attributed to the metastasized cancer, whereas, the medical expense for the treatment of cancer metastases generates heavily financial burden. The population size of metastases cases is small and comprehensive inferencing and prognosis is hard to conduct. METHODS: Because metastases and finance state can develop dynamic transitions over time, this study proposes a semi-Markov model to perform risk and economic evaluation associated to major cancer metastasis (i.e., lung, brain, liver and lymphoma cancer) against rare cases. A nationwide medical database in Taiwan was employed to derive a baseline study population and costs data. The time until development of metastasis and survivability from metastasis, as well as the medical costs were estimated through a semi-Markov based Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS: In terms of the survivability and risk associated to metastatic cancer patients, 80% lung and liver cancer cases are tended to metastasize to other part of the body. The highest cost is generated by brain cancer-liver metastasis patients. The survivors group generated approximately 5 times more costs, in average, than the non-survivors group. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed model provides a healthcare decision-support tool to evaluate the survivability and expenditure of major cancer metastases.',\n"," \"Molecular origins of mutational spectra produced by the environmental carcinogen N-nitrosodimethylamine and S(N)1 chemotherapeutic agents.DNA-methylating environmental carcinogens such as N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and certain alkylators used in chemotherapy form O (6)-methylguanine (m6G) as a functionally critical intermediate. NDMA is a multi-organ carcinogen found in contaminated water, polluted air, preserved foods, tobacco products, and many pharmaceuticals. Only ten weeks after exposure to NDMA, neonatally-treated mice experienced elevated mutation frequencies in liver, lung and kidney of ∼35-fold, 4-fold\\xa0and 2-fold, respectively. High-resolution mutational spectra (HRMS) of liver and lung revealed distinctive patterns dominated by GC→AT mutations in 5'-Pu-G-3' contexts, very similar to human COSMIC mutational signature SBS11. Commonly associated with alkylation damage, SBS11 appears in cancers treated with the DNA alkylator temozolomide (TMZ). When cells derived from the mice were treated with TMZ, N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, and streptozotocin (two other therapeutic methylating agents), all displayed NDMA-like HRMS, indicating mechanistically convergent mutational processes. The role of m6G in shaping the mutational spectrum of NDMA was probed by removing MGMT, the main cellular defense against m6G. MGMT-deficient mice displayed a strikingly enhanced mutant frequency, but identical HRMS, indicating that the mutational properties of these alkylators is likely owed to sequence-specific DNA binding. In sum, the HRMS of m6G-forming agents constitute an early-onset biomarker of exposure to DNA methylating carcinogens and drugs.\",\n"," 'Development of certain aminoquinazoline scaffolds as potential multitarget anticancer agents with apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects: Design, synthesis and biological evaluation.Newly designed 4 11a, b, 12a, b and 13a, b) have been synthesized and evaluated for their potential multitarget anticancer activities, apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects. Thereupon, in vitro cytotoxic activities of all the synthesized compounds were screened against NCI 60 human cancer cell lines (nine subpanels) at NCI, USA. Successfully, 2-morpholino-N-(quinazolin-4-yl) acetohydrazide 5e was granted an NSC code, owing to its significant potency and broad spectrum of activity against various cancer cell lines; leukemia K-562, non-small cell lung cancer NCI-H522 cells, colon cancer SW-620, melanoma LOX IMVI, MALME-3M, renal cancer RXF 393, ACHN and breast cancer MDA-MB231/ATCC (GI% = 99.6, 161, 126.03, 90.22, 174.47, 139.7, 191 and 97, respectively). Compound 5e showed the best inhibitory activity (GI(50)\\xa0=\\xa01.3\\xa0µM) against melanoma LOX IMVI, when tested at five doses against NCI 60 cell lines. Furthermore, compound 5e showed comparable EGFR and CDK2 inhibitory activity results (IC(50)\\xa0=\\xa00.093\\xa0±\\xa00.006\\xa0μM and 0.143\\xa0±\\xa00.008\\xa0μM, respectively) to those of lapatinib and ribociclib (IC(50)\\xa0=\\xa00.03\\xa0±\\xa00.002\\xa0μM and 0.067\\xa0±\\xa00.004\\xa0μM, respectively). Western blotting analysis of compound 5e against melanoma LOX IMVI marked out significant reduced EGFR and CDK2 protein expression percentages, up to 32.97% and 34.09%, respectively, if compared to lapatinib (31.18%) and ribociclib (29.66%). Moreover, compound 5e caused clear cell cycle arrests at S phase of renal UO-31 cells and at G1 phase of both breast cancer MCF7 and ovarian cancer IGROV1, associated with remarkable increase of DNA content of the controls. In accordance, it demonstrated promising anti- proliferative and apoptotic activities, showing a significant increase in total apoptotic percentages of renal cancer UO-31, breast cancer MCF7 and ovarian IGROV1 cancer cell lines, if compared to the control untreated cells (from 1.79% to 46.72%, 2.19% to 39.02% and 1.66 to 42.51%, respectively). Molecular modelling and dynamic simulation study results supported the main objectives of the present work.',\n"," 'Expanding the scope of preoperative localization.nan',\n"," 'CT-guided indocyanine green and lipiodol marking of ground glass opacity before robotic-assisted lung resection.nan',\n"," 'GD2 CAR-T cells in combination with Nivolumab exhibit enhanced antitumor efficacy.Glioblastoma (GBM) is a common primary brain tumor with poor clinical prognosis. Although CAR-T therapy has been trialed for treatment of GBM, the outcomes are sub-optimal possibly due to exhaustion of T cells and life-threatening neurotoxicity. To address these issues, a combined therapeutic strategy was tested in the current study using GD2 CAR-T together with Nivolumab - an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody. An effector-to-target co-culture system was established to evaluate the short-term and long-term cytotoxicity of CAR-T, as well as to investigate the inhibitory activity and T cell exhaustion associated with the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway. Orthotopic NOD/SCID GBM animal models were generated to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combined therapeutic strategy at various dosages of GD2 CAR-T with Nivolumab. GD2 CAR-T exhibited significant antigen-specific cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. The persistence of cytotoxicity of GD2 CAR-T could be enhanced by addition of Nivolumab in the co-culture system. Animal studies suggested that GD2 CAR-T effectively infiltrated into tumor tissue and significantly hampered tumor progression. The optimal therapeutic outcome was obtained via using the medium dosage of CAR-T with Nivolumab, which displayed the highest efficacy in extending the survival up to 60 days. Further investigation of toxicity revealed that high-dosage of GD2 CAR-T could induce tumor apoptosis through p53/caspase-3/PARP signaling pathway. This study suggests that GD2 CAR-T in combination with Nivolumab may offer an improved therapeutic strategy for treatment of GBM.',\n"," 'Thermal ablation for primary and metastatic lung tumors: Single-center analysis of peri-procedural and intermediate-term clinical outcomes.PURPOSE: To evaluate the peri-procedural and intermediate-term clinical outcomes of thermal ablation of primary and metastatic lung cancer through analysis of a 5-year institutional experience. METHODS: In this retrospective, IRB-approved study, 55 consecutive lung ablation interventions (33 cryoablation and 22 microwave ablations) performed at an academic medical center from 2017 to 2022 were evaluated. Cryoablation was performed utilizing multiple 14-guage probes using a triple freeze/thaw protocol. Microwave ablation required a single 14-guage probe, set to 60-80 watts for 5-10\\xa0min. Lung disease distribution was 58.2\\xa0% bilateral with largest lesion size of 5.5\\xa0cm. Periprocedural outcomes including technical success and complications as well as long-term outcomes including radiographic response, objective response ratio (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and functional status were elucidated. RESULTS: Technical success rate was 100\\xa0%. The most common complication was pneumothorax which occurred in 36 (65.5\\xa0%) patients, with 27 (49.1\\xa0%) requiring chest tube placement. At 6\\xa0months, 52 (98.2\\xa0%) of the patients demonstrated a complete response and 1 patient exhibited a partial response, yielding an ORR and a DCR of 100\\xa0%. The PFS was 26\\xa0±\\xa019\\xa0months, and the OS was 90.9\\xa0%, 83.6\\xa0%, and 74.5\\xa0% at 1, 3, and 5\\xa0years, respectively. Additionally, 92.7\\xa0% (51) of patients maintained or improved their functional status (ECOG) at 6\\xa0months. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous thermal ablation techniques are evolving and promising treatments for both primary and metastatic lung tumors. Our 5-year institutional experience demonstrated their safety and efficacy with preservation of functional performance.',\n"," 'Effective voltammetric tool for simultaneous detection of MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-9; important non-small cell lung cancer biomarkers.Simultaneous detection of multiple biomarkers can allow to reduce the costs of medical diagnostics, and thus improve the accuracy and effectiveness of disease diagnosis and prognosis. Here, for the first time, we present a low-cost, simple, and rapid method for simultaneous detection of three matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-9) that play important roles in the progression of lung cancer. The sensor matrix was constructed using a G2 polyamidoamine dendrimer (PAMAM) containing amino, carboxyl, and sulfhydryl groups. The recognition process was based on specific enzymatic cleavage of the Gly-Ile peptide bond by MMP-1, Gly-Leu bond by MMP-2, and Gly-Met bond by MMP-9, and monitoring was done by square wave voltammetry. The activity of metalloproteinases was detected based on the change of current signals of redox receptors (dipeptides labeled with electroactive compounds) covalently anchored onto the electrode surface. The conditions of the biosensor construction, including the concentration of receptors on the sensor surface and the time of interaction of the receptor with the analyte, were carefully optimized. Under optimal conditions, the linear response of the developed method ranged from 1.0⋅10(-8) to 1.0\\xa0mg⋅L(-1), and the limit of detection for MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-9 was 0.35, 0.62, and 1.10\\xa0fg⋅mL(-1), respectively. The constructed biosensor enabled us to efficiently profile the levels of active forms of MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-9 in tissue samples (plasma and lung and tumor extracts). Thus, the developed biosensor can aid in the early detection and diagnosis of lung cancer.',\n"," 'Racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in trajectories of morbidity accumulation among older Americans.INTRODUCTION: Multimorbidity, the presence of multiple chronic health conditions, generally starts in middle and older age but there is considerable heterogeneity in the trajectory of morbidity accumulation. This study aimed to clarify the number of distinct trajectories and the potential associations between race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status and these trajectories. METHODS: Data from 13,699 respondents (age ≥51) in the Health and Retirement Study between 1998 and 2016 were analyzed with growth mixture models. Nine prevalent self-reported morbidities (arthritis, cancer, cognitive impairment, depressive symptoms, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, lung disease, stroke) were summed for the morbidity count. RESULTS: Three trajectories of morbidity accumulation were identified: low [starting with few morbidities and accumulating them slowly (i.e., low intercept and low slope); 80% of sample], increasing (i.e., low intercept and high slope; 9%), and high (i.e., high intercept and low slope; 11%). Compared to non-Hispanic (NH) White adults in covariate-adjusted models, NH Black adults had disadvantages while Hispanic adults had advantages. Our results suggest a protective effect of education for NH Black adults (i.e., racial health disparities observed at low education were ameliorated and then eliminated at increasing levels of education) and a reverse pattern for Hispanic adults (i.e., increasing levels of education was found to dampen the advantages Hispanic adults had at low education). Compared with NH White adults, higher levels of wealth were protective for both NH Black adults (i.e., reducing or reversing racial health disparities observed at low wealth) and Hispanic adults (i.e., increasing the initial health advantages observed at low wealth). CONCLUSION: These findings have implications for addressing health disparities through more precise targeting of public health interventions. This work highlights the imperative to address socioeconomic inequalities that interact with race/ethnicity in complex ways to erode health.',\n"," 'Efficacy of zoledronic acid for the elimination of disseminated tumor cells in a clinically relevant, spontaneously metastatic prostate cancer xenograft model.Bone metastases develop in >90\\xa0% of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (PCa) through complex interactions between the bone microenvironment and tumor cells. Previous androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), which is known to cause bone loss, as well as anti-resorptive agents such as zoledronic acid (ZA), used to prevent skeletal complications, may influence these interactions and thereby the growth of disseminated tumor cells (DTC) in the bone marrow (BM). Here, a spontaneously metastatic xenograft tumor model of human PCa was further optimized to mimic the common clinical situation of ADT (castration) combined with primary tumor resection in vivo. The effects of these interventions, alone or in combination with ZA treatment, on tumor cell dissemination to the BM and other distant sites were analyzed. Metastatic burden was quantified by human-specific Alu-qPCR, bioluminescence imaging (BLI), and immunohistochemistry. Further, bone remodeling was assessed by static histomorphometry and serum parameters. Initial comparative analysis between NSG and SCID mice showed that spontaneous systemic dissemination of subcutaneous PC-3 xenograft tumors was considerably enhanced in NSG mice. Primary tumor resection and thereby prolonged observational periods resulted in a higher overall metastatic cell load at necropsy and tumor growth alone caused significant bone loss, which was further augmented by surgical castration. In addition, castrated mice showed a strong trend towards higher bone metastasis loads. Weekly treatment of mice with ZA completely prevented castration- and tumor-induced bone loss but had no effect on bone metastasis burden. Conversely, the total lung metastasis load as determined by BLI was significantly decreased upon ZA treatment. These findings provide a basis for future research on the role of ZA not only in preventing skeletal complications but also in reducing metastasis to other organs.',\n"," 'What are the indications and survivorship of tumor endoprosthetic reconstructions for patients with extremity metastatic bone disease?BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Given advances in therapies, endoprosthetic reconstruction (EPR) in metastatic bone disease (MBD) may be increasingly indicated. The objectives were to review the indications, and implant and patient survivorship in patients undergoing EPR for MBD. METHODS: A review of patients undergoing EPR for extremity MBD between 1992 and 2022 at two centers was performed. Surgical data, implant survival, patient survival, and implant failure modes were examined. RESULTS: One hundred fifteen patients were included with a median follow-up of 14.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 9.2-19.3) and survival of 19.4 months (95% CI: 13.6-26.1). The most common diagnosis was renal cell carcinoma (34/115, 29.6%) and the most common location was proximal femur (43/115, 37.4%). Indications included: actualized fracture (58/115, 50.4%), impending fracture (30/115, 26.1%), and failed fixation (27/115, 23.5%). Implant failure was uncommon (10/115, 8.7%). Patients undergoing EPR for failed fixation were more likely to have renal or lung cancer (p\\u2009=\\u20090.006). CONCLUSIONS: EPRs were performed most frequently for renal cell carcinoma and in patients with a relatively favorable survival. EPR was indicated for failed previous fixation in 23.5% of cases, emphasizing the importance of predictive survival modeling. EPR can be a reliable and durable surgical option for patients with MBD.',\n"," \"Rhabdomyosarcoma with isolated lung metastases: A report from the Soft Tissue Sarcoma Committee of the Children's Oncology Group.BACKGROUND: To determine outcomes of children with rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) with isolated lung metastases. METHODS: Data were analyzed for 428 patients with metastatic RMS treated on COG protocols. Categorical variables were compared using Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests. Event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. RESULTS: Compared with patients with other metastatic sites (n\\xa0=\\xa0373), patients with lung-only metastases (n\\xa0=\\xa055) were more likely to be <10 years of age, have embryonal histology (embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma), have N0 disease, and less likely to have primary extremity tumors. Lung-only patients had significantly better survival outcomes than patients with all other sites of metastatic disease (p\\xa0<\\xa0.0001) with 5-year EFS of 48.1 versus 18.8% and 5-year OS of 64.1 versus 26.9%. Patients with lung-only metastases, and those with a single extrapulmonary site of metastasis, had better survival compared with patients with two or more sites of metastatic disease (p\\xa0<\\xa0.0001). In patients with ERMS and lung-only metastases, there was no significant difference in survival between patients ≥10 years and 1-9 years (5-year EFS: 58.3 vs. 68.2%, 5-year OS: 66.7 vs. 67.7%). CONCLUSIONS: With aggressive treatment, patients with ERMS and lung-only metastatic disease have superior EFS and OS compared with patients with other sites of metastatic disease, even when older than 10 years of age. Consideration should be given to including patients ≥10 years with ERMS and lung-only metastases in the same group as those <10 years in future risk stratification algorithms.\",\n"," 'Efficacy of a growth hormone-releasing hormone agonist in a murine model of cardiometabolic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) represents a major unmet medical need owing to its diverse pathophysiology and lack of effective therapies. Potent synthetic, agonists (MR-356 and MR-409) of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) improve the phenotype of models of HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and in cardiorenal models of HFpEF. Endogenous GHRH exhibits a broad range of regulatory influences in the cardiovascular (CV) system and aging and plays a role in several cardiometabolic conditions including obesity and diabetes. Whether agonists of GHRH can improve the phenotype of cardiometabolic HFpEF remains untested and unknown. Here we tested the hypothesis that MR-356 can mitigate/reverse the cardiometabolic HFpEF phenotype. C57BL6N mice received a high-fat diet (HFD) plus the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (l-NAME) for 9 wk. After 5 wk of HFD + l-NAME regimen, animals were randomized to receive daily injections of MR-356 or placebo during a 4-wk period. Control animals received no HFD + l-NAME or agonist treatment. Our results showed the unique potential of MR-356 to treat several HFpEF-like features including cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, capillary rarefaction, and pulmonary congestion. MR-356 improved cardiac performance by improving diastolic function, global longitudinal strain (GLS), and exercise capacity. Importantly, the increased expression of cardiac pro-brain natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) was restored to normal levels suggesting that MR-356 reduced myocardial stress associated with metabolic inflammation in HFpEF. Thus, agonists of GHRH may be an effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cardiometabolic HFpEF phenotype.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This randomized study used rigorous hemodynamic tools to test the efficacy of a synthetic GHRH agonist to improve cardiac performance in a cardiometabolic HFpEF. Daily injection of the GHRH agonist, MR-356, reduced the HFpEF-like effects as evidenced by improved diastolic dysfunction, reduced cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and pulmonary congestion. Notably, end-diastolic pressure and end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship were reset to control levels. Moreover, treatment with MR-356 increased exercise capacity and reduced myocardial stress associated with metabolic inflammation in HFpEF.',\n"," 'Spirituality and Hope Levels of Lung Cancer Patients Who Had Surgery in Turkey.This study explores the relationship between spirituality and hope levels in lung cancer patients. Cancer patients often use their spirituality as a way of coping. Among a sample of 124 Turkish lung cancer patients, spirituality levels were assessed using the Spiritual Orientation Scale\\xa0(SOS)\\xa0and hope levels were measured using the Herth\\xa0Hope Scale\\xa0(HHS). Spirituality and hope levels in Turkish lung cancer patients were found to be above average. While no significant effect of demographic and disease-related variables was detected on spirituality and hope levels, spirituality and hope were found to be positively correlated in Turkish lung cancer patients.',\n"," 'Adverse impacts of Asian dust events on human health and the environment-A probabilistic risk assessment study on particulate matter-bound metals and bacteria in Seoul, South Korea.This study aimed to assess the impact of Asian dust (AD) on the human health and the environment. Particulate matter (PM) and PM-bound trace elements and bacteria were examined to determine the chemical and biological hazards associated with AD days and compared with non-AD\\xa0days in Seoul. On AD days, the mean PM10 concentration was ∼3.5 times higher than that on non-AD\\xa0days. Elements generated from the Earth\\'s crust (Al, Fe, and Ca) and anthropogenic sources (Pb, Ni, and Cd) were identified as major contributors to coarse and fine particles, respectively. During AD days, the study area was recognized as \"severe\" for pollution index and pollution load index levels, and \"moderately to heavily polluted\" for geoaccumulation index levels. The potential cancer risk (CR) and non-CR were estimated for the dust generated during AD events. On AD days, total CR levels were significant (in 1.08\\xa0×\\xa010(-5)-2.22\\xa0×\\xa010(-5)), which were associated with PM-bound As, Cd, and Ni. In addition, inhalation CR was found to be similar to the incremental lifetime CR levels estimated using the human respiratory tract mass deposition model. In a short exposure duration (14 days), high PM and bacterial mass deposition, significant non-CR levels, and a high presence of potential respiratory infection-causing pathogens (Rothia mucilaginosa) were observed during AD days. Significant non-CR levels were observed for bacterial exposure, despite insignificant levels of PM10-bound elements. Therefore, the substantial ecological risk, CR, and non-CR levels for inhalation exposure to PM-bound bacteria, and the presence of potential respiratory pathogens, indicate that AD events pose a significant risk to both human lung health and the environment. This study provides the first comprehensive examination of significant non-CR levels for bacteria and carcinogenicity of PM-bound metals during AD events.',\n"," 'A robust lyophilized kit for convenient one-step formulation of [(68)Ga]Ga-DOTA-E-[c(RGDfK)](2) in hospital radiopharmacy for clinical PET imaging.The present article describes the development of robust lyophilized kit for convenient formulation of [(68)Ga]Ga-DOTA-E-[c(RGDfK)](2) (E\\xa0=\\xa0glutamic acid, R = arginine, G = glycine, D = aspartic acid, f\\xa0=\\xa0phenylalanine, K\\xa0=\\xa0lysine) radiopharmaceutical for clinical use in non-invasive monitoring of malignancies overexpressing integrin α(v)β(3) receptors. Five batches of the kit were prepared with optimized kit contents, all of which showed high (68)Ga-radiolabeling yield (>98%). Pre-clinical evaluation of the [(68)Ga]Ga-radiotracer in SCID mice bearing FTC133 tumour exhibited significant accumulation in the tumor xenograft. Preliminary human clinical investigation carried out in a 60 year old male patient with metastatic lung cancer revealed high radiotracer uptake in the tumor along with satisfactory target to non-target contrast. The developed kit formulation also showed a long shelf-life of at least 12 months on storage at 0\\xa0°C. All these results point towards the promising attributes of the developed kit formulation for convenient preparation of [(68)Ga]Ga-DOTA-E-[c(RGDfK)](2) for routine clinical use.',\n"," 'Understanding population exposure to size-segregated aerosol and associated trace elements during residential cooking in northeastern India: Implications for disease burden and health risk.Mass-size distribution of respirable aerosol and 13 associated trace elements (TEs) were investigated in rural kitchens using liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), firewood and mixed biomass fuels across three northeastern Indian states. The averaged PM(10) (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter\\xa0≤\\xa010\\xa0μm) and ΣTE concentrations were 403 and 30\\xa0μg\\xa0m(-3) for LPG, 2429 and 55\\xa0μg\\xa0m(-3) for firewood, and 1024 and 44\\xa0μg\\xa0m(-3) for mixed biomass-using kitchens. Mass-size distributions were tri-modal with peaks in the ultrafine (0.05-0.08\\xa0μm), accumulation (0.20-1.05\\xa0μm), and coarse (3.20-4.57\\xa0μm) modes. Respiratory deposition, estimated using the multiple path particle dosimetry model, ranged from 21\\xa0% to 58\\xa0% of the total concentration across fuel types and population age categories. Head, followed by pulmonary and tracheobronchial, was the most vulnerable deposition region, and children were the most susceptible age group. Inhalation risk assessment of TEs revealed significant non-carcinogenic as well as carcinogenic risk, especially for biomass fuel users. The potential years of life lost (PYLL) was the highest for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD: 15.9\\xa0±\\xa03.8\\xa0years) followed by lung cancer (10.3\\xa0±\\xa00.3\\xa0years) and pneumonia (10.1\\xa0±\\xa00.1\\xa0years), while the PYLL rate was also highest for COPD, with Cr(VI) being the major contributor. Overall, these findings reveal the significant health burden faced by the northeastern Indian population from indoor cooking using solid biomass fuels.',\n"," 'Computational study of novel natural inhibitors targeting Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog G12C.Lung adenocarcinoma is one of the most aggressive and rapidly fatal types of malignant lung tumor. Molecular docking and virtual screening were effectively and systematically used to identify specific targets in malignant tumors and screen potential drugs. Here, we screen perfect leading compounds from a medicate library (ZINC15 database) and analyze their properties (conveyance, absorption, metabolism, excretion, and harmless forecasts) with potential inhibition of Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog (KRAS) G12C. Further results demonstrated that ZINC000013817014 and ZINC000004098458 were screened out from the ZINC15 database and were identified to have a much better binding affinity and more favorable interaction vitality binding with KRAS G12C and less rat carcinogenicity, Ames mutagenicity, way better dissolvability in water and noninhibition with cytochrome P-450 2D6. Molecular dynamics simulation analysis indicated that the binding capacity of these two compounds and KRAS G12C, ZINC000013817014-KRAS G12C, and ZINC000004098458-KRAS G12C is stable in the natural environment. Our findings reveal that ZINC000013817014 and ZINC000004098458 were perfect leading compounds to be inhibitors binding with KRAS G12C, which were selected as safe drug candidates and a cornerstone for KRAS G12C-related medicine plan and improvement. What is more, we have conducted a Cell Counting Kit-8 to verify the exactly inhibitory effects of the two selected drugs on Lung adenocarcinoma.

Our experience on 103 cases.BACKGROUND: Brain metastases (BM) occur in the natural course of malignant tumors in 18-40% of cases. Their management has changed considerably over the past decade thanks to the advent of Gamma knife Stereotactic Radiosurgery (GKSR). OBJECTIVE: We report our experience on Single Brain metastasis treated with (GKSR). METHODS: Patients treated by Gamma Knife stereotaxic radiosurgery (GKSR) in our institution between 2009 and 2021 for Single BM were recorded retrospectively. RESULTS: A total of 103 patients (n\\xa0=\\xa052; 50.5% females) were included, with a mean age of 56.33\\xa0±\\xa011.33. Breast (n\\xa0=\\xa039, 37.9%) and lung (n\\xa0=\\xa036, 35%) were the common original location for the primary tumors. GKSR alone without prior surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy was achieved in 81.5% (n\\xa0=\\xa084). Thirteen patients (15.1%) progressed in BM volume while finding the appearance of de novo BM in 5 (5.8%) patients. The median percentage of tumor control after radiosurgery treatment was 70% (IQR: 65-78) and only 26.2% (n\\xa0=\\xa027) of patients had >\\xa080% tumor control and stability over the median follow-up time of 5 (95% CI, 4-6) months. We found only two cases of radionecrosis (1.9%). The median survival time was 5.21 (IQR, 3-8) months. Retreatment, recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) class, and tumor stability influenced the overall survival of BM respectively (Hazard Ratio adjust (HRa)=\\xa05.610,p\\xa0=\\xa00.045; HRa=\\xa06.133,p\\xa0=\\xa00.031; HRa=\\xa022.463, p\\xa0=\\xa00.036).

Historically, these processes typically required single-gene sequencing, next-generation sequencing, or visual inspection of histopathology slides by experienced pathologists in a clinical context. In the past decade, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have demonstrated remarkable potential in assisting physicians with accurate diagnosis of oncology image-recognition tasks. Meanwhile, AI techniques make it possible to integrate multimodal data such as radiology, histology, and genomics, providing critical guidance for the stratification of patients in the context of precision therapy. Given that the mutation detection is unaffordable and time-consuming for a considerable number of patients, predicting gene mutations based on routine clinical radiological scans or whole-slide images of tissue with AI-based methods has become a hot issue in actual clinical practice. In this review, we synthesized the general framework of multimodal integration (MMI) for molecular intelligent diagnostics beyond standard techniques. Then we summarized the emerging applications of AI in the prediction of mutational and molecular profiles of common cancers (lung, brain, breast, and other tumor types) pertaining to radiology and histology imaging. Furthermore, we concluded that there truly exist multiple challenges of AI techniques in the way of its real-world application in the medical field, including data curation, feature fusion, model interpretability, and practice regulations. Despite these challenges, we still prospect the clinical implementation of AI as a highly potential decision-support tool to aid oncologists in future cancer treatment management.',\n"," 'Estimating stage-specific sensitivity for cancer screening tests.OBJECTIVES: When evaluating potential new cancer screening modalities, estimating sensitivity, especially for early-stage cases, is critical. There are methods to approximate stage-specific sensitivity in asymptomatic populations, both in the prospective (active screening) and retrospective (stored specimens) scenarios. We explored their validity via a simulation study. METHODS: We fit natural history models to lung and ovarian cancer screening data that permitted estimation of stage-specific (early/late) true sensitivity, defined as the probability subjects screened in the given stage had positive tests. We then ran simulations, using the fitted models, of the prospective and retrospective scenarios. Prospective sensitivity by stage was estimated as screen-detected divided by screen-plus interval-detected cancers, where stage is defined as stage at detection. Retrospective sensitivity by stage was estimated based on cancers detected within specified windows before clinical diagnosis with stage defined as stage at clinical diagnosis. RESULTS: Stage-specific true sensitivities estimated by the lung cancer natural history model were 47% (early) and 63% (late). Simulation results for the prospective setting gave estimated sensitivities of 81% (early) versus 62% (late). In the retrospective scenario, early/late sensitivity estimates were 35%/57% (1-year window) and 27%/49% (2-year window). In the prospective scenario, most subjects with negative early-stage screens presented as other than early-stage interval cases. Results were similar for ovarian cancer, with estimated prospective sensitivity much greater than true sensitivity for early stage, 84% versus 25%. CONCLUSIONS: Existing methods for approximating stage-specific sensitivity in both prospective and retrospective scenarios are unsatisfactory; improvements are needed before they can be considered to be reliable.',\n"," 'CircRNA circ_POLA2 overexpression suppresses cell apoptosis by downregulating PTEN in glioblastoma.The oncogenic role of circ_POLA2 has only been explored in lung cancer, whereas the role of which in glioblastoma (GBM) is unclear. Our research explored the involvement of circ_POLA2 in GBM. Circ_POLA2 and phosphatasetensinhomolog (PTEN) mRNA levels in GBM and paired nontumor tissues collected from 58 GBM patients were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Circ_POLA2 and PTEN were overexpressed in GBM cells to study their interaction by RT-qPCR and Western blot. The roles of circ_POLA2 and PTEN in regulating GBM cell apoptosis were explored using cell apoptosis assay. Our data revealed that circ_POLA2 was upregulated and PTEN was downregulated in GBM. PTEN showed an inverse correlation to circ_POLA2 across GBM tissues, In GBM cells, circ_POLA2 overexpression decreased PTEN accumulation, but PTEN overexpression failed to significantly affect circ_POLA2 expression. Moreover, PTEN reduced the inhibitory effects of circ_POLA2 on GBM cell apoptosis. Circ_POLA2 is overexpressed in MCL and might promote GBM cell apoptosis through downregulating PTEN.',\n"," 'Neoadjuvant target therapy with ensartinib in lung adenocarcinoma with EML4-ALK fusion variant: a case report and literature review.Although neoadjuvant target therapy has been used to treat patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), most of these patients have mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene. Few patients to date have received neoadjuvant target therapy for NSCLC containing variants in genes encoding anaplastic lymphoma kinase-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ALK-TKIs). Herein, we present a 51-year-old man with a lung mass in the left lower lobe with enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. He was diagnosed with NSCLC after needle lung biopsy, with next-generation sequencing showing an echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 gene-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4-ALK) fusion variant. The patient received neoadjuvant ensartinib, a second-generation ALK-TKI, for 5\\u2009months, followed by successful lobectomy through uniportal video-assisted thoracic surgery and adjuvant ensartinib. To our knowledge, few patients with ALK-positive NSCLC had received neoadjuvant treatment with ensartinib. Findings in this patient may widen indications for neoadjuvant target therapy in the treatment of resectable stage II-IIIA ALK-positive NSCLC.',\n"," \"Statewide Examination of Access to Cancer Surgery During the COVID-19 Pandemic.INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic caused interruptions in the delivery of medical care across a wide range of conditions including cancer. Trends in surgical treatment for cancer during the pandemic have not been well described. We sought to characterize associations between the pandemic and access to surgical treatment for breast, colorectal, and lung cancer in Illinois. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study evaluating inpatient admissions at Illinois hospitals providing surgical care for lung cancer (n\\xa0=\\xa01913 cases, n\\xa0=\\xa064 hospitals), breast cancer (n\\xa0=\\xa0910 cases, n\\xa0=\\xa0108 hospitals), and colorectal cancer (n\\xa0=\\xa05339 cases, n\\xa0=\\xa0144 hospitals). Using discharge data from the Illinois Health and Hospital Association's Comparative Health Care and Hospital Data Reporting Services database, average monthly surgical case volumes were compared from 2019 to 2020. We also compared rates of cancer surgery for each cancer type, by patient characteristics, and hospital type across the three time periods using Pearson chi-squared and ANOVA testing as appropriate. Three discrete time periods were considered: prepandemic (7-12/2019), primary pandemic (4-6/2020), and pandemic recovery (7-12/2020). Hospital characteristics evaluated included hospital type (academic, community, safety net), COVID-19 burden, and baseline cancer surgery volume. RESULTS: There were 2096 fewer operations performed for breast, colorectal, and lung cancer in 2020 than 2019 in Illinois, with the greatest reductions in cancer surgery volume occurring at the onset of the pandemic in April (colorectal, -48.3%; lung, -13.1%) and May (breast, -45.2%) of 2020. During the pandemic, breast (-14.6%) and colorectal (-13.8%) cancer surgery experienced reductions in volume whereas lung cancer operations were more common (+26.4%) compared to 2019. There were no significant differences noted in gender, race, ethnicity, or insurance status among patients receiving oncologic surgery during the primary pandemic or pandemic recovery periods. Academic hospitals, hospitals with larger numbers of COVID-19 admissions, and those with greater baseline cancer surgery volumes were associated with the greatest reduction in cancer surgery during the primary pandemic period (all cancer types, P\\xa0<\\xa00.01). During the recovery period, hospitals with greater baseline breast and lung cancer surgery volumes remained at reduced surgery volumes compared to their counterparts (P\\xa0<\\xa00.01). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with significant reductions in breast and colorectal cancer operations in Illinois, while lung cancer operations remained relatively consistent. Overall, there was a net reduction in cancer surgery that was not made up during the recovery period. Academic hospitals, those caring for more COVID-19 patients, and those with greater baseline surgery volumes were most vulnerable to reduced surgery rates during peaks of the pandemic and to delays in addressing the backlog of cases.\",\n"," 'Exploration of immunotherapy in advanced pulmonary lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma.Pulmonary lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (PLELC) is a rare and histologically distinctive subtype of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). High expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and scarcity of druggable driver mutations raise the potential of immunotherapy for advanced PELEC. However, evidence on the clinical impact of immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) remained limited and unconvincing. The present study retrospectively enrolled advanced PLELC patients who received ICIs either as up-front or salvage therapy in SYSUCC between March 15, 2017 and March 15, 2022. The comparative efficacy of chemoimmunotherapy vs chemotherapy in the first-line setting and chemoimmunotherapy vs ICIs monotherapy in the ≥2 line setting was investigated. A total of 96 patients were finally enrolled; 49 PLELC patients received immunotherapy plus platinum-based chemotherapy, while 45 patients received platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line treatment. Patients with chemoimmunotherapy significantly obtain more survival benefits than those receiving chemotherapy (median progression-free survival [PFS]: 15.6 vs 8.6\\xa0months, P\\xa0=\\xa0.0015). Additionally, patients with chemoimmunotherapy obtained more PFS benefits than those with ICIs monotherapy in the ≥2 line of therapy (median PFS: 21.7\\xa0months vs 7.8\\xa0months, P\\xa0=\\xa0.094). A significant correlation was observed between prognostic nutritional index (PNI) and favorable treatment outcomes in patients receiving first-line chemoimmunotherapy (median PFS: 17.8\\xa0months vs 7.6\\xa0months, P\\u2009<\\u2009.0001). Likewise, patients in the monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR)-high group had significantly shorter PFS than the MLR-low group (median PFS: 11.2\\xa0months vs not reached, P\\xa0=\\xa0.0009). Our study elucidated the superior efficacy of ICIs therapy, especially chemoimmunotherapy in advanced PLELC, which may provide new insight into the role of immunotherapy in advanced PLELC.',\n"," 'CircRNA B cell linker regulates cisplatin sensitivity in nonsmall cell lung cancer via microRNA-25-3p/BarH‑like homeobox 2 axis.Cisplatin (DDP) was a commonly used drug in the treatment of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the current resistance of patients to DDP seriously affected its therapeutic effect. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been reported to regulate drug resistance in cells. The purpose of this paper is to study the effect of circRNA B cell linker (circ_BLNK) in DDP resistance of NSCLC. The abundances of circ_BLNK, microRNA-25-3p (miR-25-3p) and BarH‑like homeobox 2 (BARX2) were examined by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot analysis. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide assay, EdU assay and flow cytometry. Transwell assay was applied to assess cell migration and invasion. Protein levels were quantified by western blot analysis. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was enforced to confirm the links among circ_BLNK, miR-25-3p and BARX2. The mice models were enforced to evaluate tumorigenicity. Herein, circ_BLNK and BARX2 were lower-expressed, whereas miR-25-3p was higher-expressed in A549/DDP and H1299/DDP cells than their homologous parental NSCLC cells. Circ_BLNK increases improved DDP sensitivity of NSCLC cells by promoting cell apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation, migration and invasion. Moreover, we confirmed that circ_BLNK regulated BARX2 by inhibiting miR-25-3p. Accordingly, overexpression of circ_BLNK improved DDP sensitivity of NSCLC cells via miR-25-3p/BARX2 axis. Besides, circ_BLNK reduced cell resistance to DDP, thereby inhibiting tumor development in mice. Circ_BLNK promoted the DDP sensitivity of NSCLC via regulating miR-25-3p/BARX2 axis.',\n"," 'Extracellular vesicles as personalized medicine.Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released from all cells in the body, forming an important intercellular communication network that contributes to health and disease. The contents of EVs are cell source-specific, inducing distinct signaling responses in recipient cells. The specificity of EVs and their accumulation in fluid spaces that are accessible for liquid biopsies make them highly attractive as potential biomarkers and therapies for disease. The duality of EVs as favorable (therapeutic) or unfavorable (pathological) messengers is context dependent and remains to be fully determined in homeostasis and various disease states. This review describes the use of EVs as biomarkers, drug delivery vehicles, and regenerative therapeutics, highlighting examples involving viral infections, cancer, and neurological diseases. There is growing interest to provide personalized therapy based on individual patient and disease characteristics. Increasing evidence suggests that EV biomarkers and therapeutic approaches are ideal for personalized medicine due to the diversity and multifunctionality of EVs.',\n"," 'Extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer: Current management and future directions.Extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) is regarded as a refractory carcinoma associated with extremely rapid disease progression. After more than three decades without clinical advances, research on immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) combined with platinum-based chemotherapy has led to the first treatment breakthrough, establishing a new standard for the first-line treatment of ES-SCLC. Further studies have extensively evaluated small-molecule antiangiogenic drugs, PARP inhibitors, as well as lurbinectedin in SCLC and have demonstrated some benefit, although no breakthroughs have been made. In addition, newer therapeutic strategies with targeted agents, novel chemotherapeutics and immunotherapies are evolving as they are being actively explored and hold promise for patients with this disease. Notably, the preliminary identification of SCLC molecular subtypes driven by the expression of dominant transcription factors with RNA sequencing profiles has made it possible to identify molecularly tailored therapeutic approaches, which increases the potential for individualized precision treatment of SCLC. In this review, we summarize recent research advances in ES-SCLC, outline the current management of this disease and reflect on directions for future development.',\n"," 'Heterozygous germline FLCN mutation in Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome with bilateral renal hybrid oncocytic/chromophobe tumor and unilateral renal chromophobe cell carcinoma: a case report.BACKGROUND: Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant tumor syndrome caused by Folliculin (FLCN) gene mutation. The clinical manifestations are diverse, and the renal tumor is the most serious. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 51-year-old female with multiple space-occupying lesions in both kidneys, as well as bilateral renal cysts and multiple lung cysts. The resected tumors were finally diagnosed as bilateral renal hybrid oncocytic/chromophobe tumor (HOCT) and unilateral chromophobe cell carcinoma. A history of pneumothorax surgery 4 years ago was convinced. All of these strongly suggested the possibility of BHD syndrome. Gene test confirmed a heterozygous germline FLCN nonsense mutation (c.1429C\\u2009>\\u2009T, p.Arg477Ter). The patient is still doing well after 20\\xa0months of follow-up (cut-off date July 2022). CONCLUSION: This is a case of BHD syndrome presented with bilateral renal tumor, renal cysts, and multiple lung cysts, and confirmed by gene testing. Patients with any combination of one or more of the manifestations should remain\\xa0alert\\xa0to the BHD syndrome. Our report will help to deepen the understanding of the clinicopathological features and molecular changes of BHD syndrome.',\n"," \"The v8-10 variant isoform of CD44 is selectively expressed in the normal human colonic stem cell niche and frequently is overexpressed in colon carcinomas during tumor development.CD44 protein and its variant isoforms are expressed in cancer stem cells (CSCs), and various CD44 isoforms can have different functional roles in cells. Our goal was to investigate how different CD44 isoforms contribute to the emergence of stem cell (SC) overpopulation that drives colorectal cancer (CRC) development. Specific CD44 variant isoforms are selectively expressed in normal colonic SCs and become overexpressed in CRCs during tumor development. We created a unique panel of anti-CD44 rabbit genomic antibodies to 16 specific epitopes that span the entire length of the CD44 molecule. Our panel was used to comprehensively investigate the expression of different CD44 isoforms in matched pairs (n\\u2009=\\u200910) of malignant colonic tissue and adjacent normal mucosa, using two (IHC & IF) immunostaining approaches. We found that: i) CD44v8-10 is selectively expressed in the normal human colonic SC niche; ii) CD44v8-10 is co-expressed with the SC markers ALDH1 and LGR5 in normal and malignant colon tissues; iii) colon carcinoma tissues frequently (80%) stain for CD44v8-10 while staining for CD44v6 was less frequent (40%). Given that CD44v8-10 expression is restricted to cells in the normal human colonic SC niche and CD44v8-10 expression progressively increases during CRC development, CD44v8-10 expression likely contributes to the SC overpopulation that drives the development and growth of colon cancers. Since the CD44 variant v8-10 epitope is located on CD44's extracellular region, it offers great promise for targeted anti-CSC treatment approaches.\",\n"," 'Colon adenocarcinoma and Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome in a young patient: case report and exploration of pathologic implications.Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome (BHD) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by germline mutations in the folliculin gene (FLCN) that result in the functional loss of the tumor suppressor folliculin. It is classically associated with cutaneous hamartomas, pulmonary cysts with spontaneous pneumothorax, and various renal cancers. In this case, we present a patient initially diagnosed with chromophobe renal cell carcinoma and subsequently found to have colorectal cancer (CRC). The presence of two separate malignancies in a young patient with a strong family history of CRC (father and paternal grandfather) led to genetic testing, which revealed an FLCN c.1177-5_1177-3del mutation, and a diagnosis of BHD was made. Out of the more than 300 known unique mutations of the FLCN coding region, the c.1285dupC mutation on exon 11 has been the only one convincingly associated with CRC thus far. While larger cohort studies are needed to further clarify this association, we present the first patient with CRC to our knowledge with an FLCN c.1177-5_1177-3del mutation and loss of heterozygosity implicating it as an initiating factor in tumorigenesis. We further explore the studies supporting and refuting the connection between BHD and CRC and highlight the molecular signaling pathways that may play a role in pathogenesis.',\n"," 'Barriers and recommendations for colorectal cancer screening in Africa.BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide. The incidence of CRC is rising in low- and middle-income countries but decreasing in high-income countries due to the widespread use of surveillance colonoscopy. In Africa, the implementation of screening programs remains a challenge, even in countries, such as Ghana that have established CRC screening guidelines. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review was to identify the barriers and recommend strategies for implementing CRC screening in African countries. METHODS: A literature search using PubMed was conducted with the following search terms: colorectal neoplasm, early detection of cancer, mass screening, colonoscopy, faecal occult blood test, faecal immunochemical test (FIT) and Africa. After inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, a total of 13 articles were reviewed. RESULTS: The most common barriers reported were limited endoscopic capacity, poor knowledge of CRC and CRC screening, health care factors, cultural factors and sociodemographic factors. Recommendations to increase the availability of CRC screening tests were to include the use of FITs, to provide more training for health care providers, and to expand educational programs for patients, physicians, and religious/community leaders. CONCLUSION: The primary barrier to screening for CRC in Africa is the limited endoscopic capacity, specifically the lack of infrastructure and trained personnel, which requires systematic changes by governing bodies. In addition, health care professionals should be involved in educating patients about CRC and CRC screening. Further research is needed to clarify the factors related to subtypes of CRC and to explore the feasibility of using FITs in Africa.',\n"," 'Dostarlimab: From preclinical investigation to drug approval and future directions.Immune checkpoint blockers (ICB) act by reverting the immunosuppressive phenotype of cancer cells, thus allowing host immune system to generate an immune response to the tumor. One of the key mechanisms targeted by ICB is the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, which lies onto the interaction between the programmed-cell death protein 1 and its ligand, overexpressed in several tumor types. This interaction leads to the inhibition of T-cell proliferation and their apoptosis and exhaustion. Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies are now the mainstay of treatment for several advanced stage tumors. Dostarlimab is a novel IgG4 anti-PD-1 antibody which has yielded remarkable results in mismatch-repair deficient endometrial cancer and locally advanced rectal cancer.

In this study, we designed 3-substituted quinazoline-2,4(1H,3H)-dione derivatives as dual c-Met/VEGFR-2 TK inhibitors. We introduced new synthetic methods for reported derivatives of 3-substituted quinazoline-2,4(1H,3H)-dione 2a-g, in addition to the preparation of some new derivatives namely, 3 and 4a-j. Three compounds namely, 2c, 4b, and 4e showed substantial amount of inhibition for both c-Met and VEGFR-2 TK (IC(50) range 0.052-0.084\\u2009µM). Both compounds 4b, 4e showed HB with highly conserved residue Asp1222 in the HB region of c-Met TK. For VEGFR-2 TK, compound 4b showed HB with a highly conserved residue Asp1046 in the HB region.

RNA acetylation modifications are gradually expanding in oncology. However, the role of RNA acetylation modifications in colorectal cancer and its association with colorectal cancer microsatellite status remain unclear. Using public databases and in vitro experiments, we verified the expression and biological function of NAT10, as the key RNA acetylation modification enzyme, in colorectal cancer. The results showed that NAT10 was highly expressed in colorectal cancer, and significantly promoted colorectal cancer cell proliferation. NAT10 was also involved in several aspects of cell homoeostasis such as ion transport, calcium-dependent phospholipid binding, and RNA stability. NAT10 expression positively correlated with immune infiltration in colorectal cancer. We further constructed a risk regression model for mRNA acetylation in colorectal cancer using acetylation-related differential genes. We found that tumour immune infiltration, microsatellite instability (MSI) proportion, tumour immune mutation burden, and patient response to immunotherapy were positively correlated with risk scores. For the first time, our study showed that the level of mRNA acetylation modification level is elevated in colorectal cancer and positively correlates with immune infiltration and microsatellite status of patients. Based on our findings, NAT10 may be a new target for colorectal cancer treatment.',\n"," 'Effect of antibiotic monensin on cell proliferation and IGF1R signaling pathway in human colorectal cancer cells.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of death in patients with cancers in America. Monensin has represented anti-cancer effect on various human cancer cells. We seek to investigate the effect of monensin on proliferation of human colorectal cancer cells and explore whether IGF1R signaling pathway is involved in anti-cancer mechanism of monensin. METHODS: Cell proliferation and migration were assessed by crystal violet staining and cell wounding assay respectively. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by Hoechst 33258 staining and flow cytometry. Cell cycle progression was detected with the use of flow cytometry. Cancer-associated pathways were assessed with the use of pathway-specific reporters. Gene expression was detected by touchdown-quantitative real-time PCR. Inhibition of IGF1R was tested by immunofluorescence staining. Inhibition of IGF1R signaling was accomplished by adenovirus-mediated expression of IGF1. RESULTS: We found that monensin not only effectively inhibited cell proliferation, cell migration as well as cell cycle progression, but also induced apoptosis and G1 arrest in human colorectal cancer cells. Monensin was shown to target multiple cancer-related signaling pathways such as Elk1, AP1, as well as Myc/max, and suppressed IGF1R expression via increasing IGF1 in colorectal cancer cells. CONCLUSION: Monensin could suppressed IGF1R expression via increasing IGF1 in colorectal cancer cells. It has the potential to be repurposed as an anti-colorectal cancer agent, but further studies are still required to investigate the detailed mechanisms of monensin underlying its anti-cancer motion.Key MessagesMonensin inhibits the cell proliferation and the migration, induces apoptosis and inhibits cell cycle progression in human colorectal cancer cells.Monensin may exert anti-cancer activity by targeting multiple signaling pathways, including the IGF1R signaling pathway.Monensin has the potential to be repurposed as an anti-colorectal cancer agent.',\n"," 'Curative en bloc resection of a laterally spreading mixed-nodular papillary tumor with endoscopic submucosal dissection: a case report.nan',\n"," 'Bioinformatic analysis of the clinicopathological and prognostic significance of oocyte-arresting BTG4 mRNA expression in gynecological cancers.BTG4 arrests the cell cycle and suppresses oocyte and embryonic development. We performed a bioinformatic analysis of BTG4 expression. BTG4 expression was downregulated in breast cancer compared with normal tissues (p\\u2009<\\u2009.05), but the opposite was observed in cervical, endometrial and ovarian cancers (p\\u2009<\\u2009.05). BTG4 methylation was negatively correlated with its mRNA expression in breast, cervical and endometrial cancers (p\\u2009<\\u2009.05). BTG4 mRNA expression was negatively correlated with T staging and distant metastasis of breast cancer; and with tumor invasion, clinical stage, low weight and BMI, low histological grade and no diabetes in endometrial cancer but positively with T stage and non-keratinizing squamous carcinoma in endometrial cancer. BTG4 expression was negatively correlated with the survival of ovarian cancer patients (p\\u2009<\\u2009.05), but positively for breast, cervical and endometrial cancers (p\\u2009<\\u2009.05). BTG4 expression is thus a potential marker reflecting the carcinogenesis, aggressiveness and prognosis in gynecological cancers.Impact StatementWhat is already known on this subject? Previous studies have revealed the structure and location of BTG4. BTG4 inhibit cell proliferative, promote apoptosis, induce G1 cell cycle arrest. BTG4 promotes the development of mouse embryos from cell stage 1 to 2. The methylation and biological function of BTG4 were clarified in gastric and/or colorectal cancer cells.What do the results of this study add? BTG4 is found to closely link to reflect the carcinogenesis, histogenesis, aggressive behaviors and prognosis of gynecological cancers, and involved in ligand-receptor interaction, microtubule motor activity, dynein light chain binding, cilium organization, assembly, and movement in endometrial and ovarian cancers.What are the implications of these finding for clinical practice and/or further research?

We compared 2018 American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) CRC incidence rates in Alaska to other Tribal, racial, and international population rates. AI/AN persons in Alaska had the highest CRC incidence rate among US Tribal and racial groups (61.9/100,000 in 2018). AI/AN persons in Alaska also had higher rates than those reported for any other country in the world in 2018 except for Hungary, where males had a higher CRC incidence rate than AI/AN males in Alaska (70.6/100,000 and 63.6/100,000 respectively). This review of CRC incidence rates from populations in the United States and worldwide showed that AI/AN persons in Alaska had the highest documented incidence rate of CRC in the world in 2018.

Western blot was performed to analyze the expression of WTAP, FLNA and autophagy-related proteins in cells. Our results confirmed the up-regulation of WTAP in colon cancer and its promoting effect on proliferation and inhibiting effect on apoptosis. FLNA was the downstream gene of WTAP and WTAP-regulated m6A modification led to post-transcriptional repression of FLNA. The rescue experiments showed that WTAP/FLNA could inhibit autophagy.

The underlying mechanism involves the suppression of the Yes-associated protein. However, the specific role of LAF in cell cycle regulation remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study determined the molecular mechanism by which LAF regulates cell cycle progression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Various colon cancer cell lines (SW480, HCT15, and HCT116) were treated with LAF (25, 50, and 75\\u2009μmol/L) for 48\\u2009h. The effects of LAF on cell proliferation and cell cycle were determined using sulforhodamine B and flow cytometry assays. Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified using quantitative proteomics. Bioinformatic analysis of DEPs was conducted via Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. Expression levels of DEPs in the cell cycle pathway were analyzed using RT-qPCR and western blotting. RESULTS: LAF suppressed the proliferation of SW480, HCT15, and HCT116 cells (IC(50) 47.1, 51.4, and 32.8\\u2009μmol/L, respectively) and induced cell cycle arrest at the S phase. A total of 6331 proteins were identified and quantified, of which 127 were differentially expressed between the LAF-treated and untreated groups. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed that DEPs mainly participated in the cell cycle. CDKN1C/p57 showed the most significant differential expression, with the highest fold-change (3.155-fold).

METHODS: We analysed data collected from the European Health Interview Survey 2013-2015, including individuals aged 40-74 (n\\u2009=\\u2009179,318), 15,172 with diabetes from 29 countries. The income of a household (HHI) was described in quintiles. The relationship between the coverage of preventive services (cardiometabolic, vaccination, cancer screening) and sociodemographic characteristics was analysed with multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Women comprised 53.8% of the total and 40% were 60-74\\u2009years. People with diabetes compared to those without diabetes had higher reported coverage of cardiometabolic screening (98.4% vs. 90.0% in cholesterol measurement; 97.0% vs. 93.6% in blood pressure measurement), colorectal cancer screening (27.1% vs. 24.6%) but lower coverage of gynaecological cancer screening (mammography: 29.2% vs. 33.5%, pap smear test: 28.3% vs. 37.9%). Among diabetic patients, women were less likely to receive cholesterol screening (OR = 0.81; 95% CI: 0.72-0.91) and colon cancer screening (OR = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.73-0.86) compared to men. Being affluent was positively associated with receiving cardiometabolic screening and mammography in diabetic patients. CONCLUSION: People with diabetes reported higher coverage of preventive services except gynaecological cancer screening. Disparities were found in diabetes among women and less affluent individuals.',\n"," 'Cutting into the black sea: endoscopic submucosal dissection using a clip with line for a rectal polyp with severe fibrosis after tattooing.nan',\n"," 'Non-pathogenic microbiota accelerate age-related CpG Island methylation in colonic mucosa.DNA methylation is an epigenetic process altered in cancer and ageing. Age-related methylation drift can be used to estimate lifespan and can be influenced by extrinsic factors such as diet. Here, we report that non-pathogenic microbiota accelerate age-related methylation drift in the colon when compared with germ-free mice. DNA methylation analyses showed that microbiota and IL10KO were associated with changes in 5% and 4.1% of CpG sites, while mice with both factors had 18% alterations. Microbiota, IL10KO, and their combination altered 0.4%, 0.4%, and 4% of CpG island methylation, respectively. These are comparable to what is seen in colon cancer. Ageing changes were accelerated in the IL10KO mice with microbiota, and the affected genes were more likely to be altered in colon cancer. Thus, the microbiota affect DNA methylation of the colon in patterns reminiscent of what is observed in ageing and colorectal cancer.',\n"," 'Traction by dental floss loop for adequate submucosal dissection depth in a rectal neuroendocrine tumor.nan',\n"," 'Virtual scale endoscope-assisted wide-field resection of large sessile serrated lesions.nan',\n"," 'High endothelial venules proportion in tertiary lymphoid structure is a prognostic marker and correlated with anti-tumor immune microenvironment in colorectal cancer.BACKGROUND: High endothelial venules (HEV) and tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) are associated with clinical outcomes of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). However, because HEV are components of TLS, there have been few studies of the role of the HEV proportion in TLS (HEV/TLS). This study investigated the role of the HEV/TLS and its relationship with the tumor immune microenvironment in CRC. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 203 cases of tissue pathologically diagnosed as CRC after general surgery was performed at the First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University from January 2014 to July 2017. Paraffin sections were obtained from the paracancerous intestinal mucosal tissues. The area of HEV and TLS and immune cells were detected by immunohistochemistry. We further divided the positive HEV expression group into the high HEV/TLS group and the low HEV/TLS group by the average area of HEV/TLS. After grouping, the data were also analyzed using the chi-square test, Kaplan-Meier method, and univariate and multivariate Cox proportional risk regression analyses. A correlation analysis of the HEV/TLS and immune cells as well as angiogenesis was performed. RESULTS: Patients with a high HEV/TLS in CRC tissue were associated with longer OS, DFS and lower TNM stage. Meanwhile, CRC tissue with a high HEV/TLS showed a greater ability to recruit the CD3+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and M1 macrophages and correlated with less angiogenesis. Conclusively, high HEV/TLS links to the favorable prognosis of CRC patients and correlated with anti-tumor immune microenvironment, which can be a potential biomarker for prognosis of CRC patients. CONCLUSION: A high HEV/TLS is associated with a favorable prognosis for CRC and is correlated with the anti-tumor immune microenvironment. Therefore, it is a potential biomarker of the CRC prognosis.KEY MESSAGESHigh HEV/TLS is associated with a favorable prognosis for CRC.High HEV/TLS correlated with the anti-tumor immune microenvironment of CRC and can serve as a novel prognostic biomarker.',\n"," 'A case of rectal diverticulitis resembling a submucosal tumor under colorectal endoscopy: a hitherto undescribed lesion.nan',\n"," 'Endoscopic submucosal dissection of colonic residual laterally spreading tumor with adaptive traction: use of the additional loops to improve traction focally in difficult area.nan',\n"," 'Endoscopic intermuscular dissection for a lower rectal gastrointestinal stromal tumor.nan',\n"," 'Combining endoscopic mucosal resection with hybrid argon plasma coagulation to reduce local colorectal lesion recurrence: a video tutorial.nan',\n"," 'Underwater endoscopic submucosal dissection of a relapsing neoplastic colorectal lesion after surgery and radiotherapy: water to the rescue!nan',\n"," 'Sprouty4 is epigenetically upregulated in human colorectal cancer.Sprouty4 (SPRY4) has been frequently reported as a tumor suppressor and is therefore downregulated in various cancers. For the first time, we report that SPRY4 is epigenetically upregulated in colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, we explored DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation levels of SPRY4 in CRC cells and patient samples and correlated these findings with mRNA and protein expression levels. Three loci within the promoter region of SPRY4 were evaluated for 5mC levels in CRC using the combined bisulfite restriction analysis. In addition, hydroxymethylation levels within SPRY4 were measured in CRC patients. Lastly, DNA methylation and mRNA expression data were extracted from CRC patients in multiple high-throughput data repositories like Gene Expression Omnibus and The Cancer Genome Atlas. Combined in vitro and in silico analysis of promoter methylation levels of SPRY4 clearly demonstrates that the distal promoter region undergoes hypomethylation in CRC patients and is associated with increased expression. Moreover, a decrease in gene body hydroxymethylation and an increase in gene body methylation within the coding region of SPRY4 were found in CRC patients and correlated with increased expression. SPRY4 is epigenetically upregulated in CRC by promoter hypomethylation and hypermethylation within the gene body that warrants future investigation of atypical roles of this established tumor suppressor.',\n"," 'Endoscopic full-thickness resection with reconstruction of the rectal wall.nan',\n"," 'Colonic intussusception due to filiform polyposis of ulcerative colitis treated by endoscopic reduction.nan',\n"," 'Telomerase RNA component lncRNA as potential diagnostic biomarker promotes CRC cellular migration and apoptosis evasion via modulation of β-catenin protein level.AIM: Long non-coding RNA (LncRNA) telomerase RNA component (TERC) has telomerase-dependent and independent activity in numerous cancer types. The present study purposes to demonstrate the role of lncRNA TERC as a diagnostic serum biomarker in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and the molecular mechanism of lncRNA TERC in inducing tumor in CRC cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PCR array was performed to examine lncRNAs dysregulated in CRC. LncRNA TERC expression level was evaluated in 70 CRC patients and 35 control subjects using RT-qPCR. Then transfection was performed to build down-expression models of lncRNA TERC. ROC curve analysis was applied to assess the diagnostic value of serum LncRNA CRC. In addition, RT-qPCR was used to detect expression level of lncRNA TERC and β-catenin mRNA. Moreover, ELISA and Western blot were used to detect the level of β-catenin protein in sera of CRC patients and cell lines. The biological functions such as cell growth and migration of CRC cells were assessed using a wound healing assay. Cell cycle analysis and apoptosis analysis were performed using flow cytometry. RESULTS: The lncRNA TERC is overexpressed in the sera of CRC patients with high diagnostic and stage discrimination accuracy. Furthermore, lncRNA TERC expression was upregulated in CRC cell lines and lncRNA TERC silencing induced cell arrest and apoptosis and inhibited cell migration. Furthermore, inhibition of lncRNA TERC reduces β-catenin protein levels. CONCLUSION: The lncRNA TERC could be considered as an early stages CRC diagnostic biomarker with a good ability to discriminate between CRC stages. lncRNA TERC induces CRC by promoting cell migration and evading apoptosis by elevating the level of β-catenin protein.',\n"," 'Ionizable polymeric nanocarriers for the codelivery of bi-adjuvant and neoantigens in combination tumor immunotherapy.Ionizable lipid nanocarriers have made historical contribution to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Here, we report ionizable polymeric nanoparticles that co-deliver bi-adjuvant and neoantigen peptides for cancer immunotherapy in combination with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Current cancer ICB benefits only a small subset of patients, largely due to a lack of pre-existing target cells and checkpoint targets for ICB, tumor antigenic heterogeneity, and tumor immunosuppression. Therapeutic vaccines hold the potential to enhance ICB therapeutic efficacy by expanding antitumor cell repertoires, upregulating immune checkpoint levels and hence sensitizing ICB, and reducing tumor immunosuppression. Chemically defined peptide vaccines are attractive, but their current therapeutic efficacy has been limited due to 1) poor vaccine delivery to immunomodulatory lymph nodes (LNs) and antigen (Ag)-presenting cells (APCs), 2) poor immunostimulant adjuvant efficacy with restricted target cell subsets in humans, 3) limited adjuvant/Ag codelivery to enhance Ag immunogenicity, and 4) limited ability to overcome tumor antigenic heterogeneity. Here, we developed nanovaccines (NVs) using pH-responsive polymeric micellular nanoparticles (NPs) for the codelivery of bi-adjuvant [Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/8 agonist R848 and TLR9 agonist CpG] and peptide neoantigens (neoAgs) to draining LNs for efficient Ag presentation in a broad range of APC subsets. These NVs potentiated the immunogenicity of peptide Ags and elicits robust antitumor T cell responses with memory, and remodeled the tumor immune milium with reduced tumor immunosuppression. As a result, NVs significantly enhanced ICB therapeutic efficacy for murine colorectal tumors and orthotopic glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). These results suggest marked potential of bi-adjuvant/neoAg-codelivering NVs for combination cancer immunotherapy.',\n"," 'Characteristics of adenomatous colorectal polyps among a Saudi population.OBJECTIVES: Colorectal cancer is a common cause of cancer-related mortality in KSA with a rising incidence. Although adenomatous polyps are well-recognized as precursors of colorectal cancer, local data are scarce. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the characteristics of adenomatous colon polyps in the Saudi population. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the electronic databases of all patients who underwent colonoscopy for any indication between January 2015 and December 2019 at a tertiary care hospital. This study included adult patients who were found to have colorectal polyps with identified histopathology reports. We collected clinical and pathological data, including patient age, sex, and histopathological polyp characteristics. A p-value <0.05 was considered significant for descriptive and analytical statistics. RESULTS: A total of 184 patients with colorectal polyps with identified histopathology reports were included in the analysis. Of these, 130 (70.6%) patients were aged 50 years or older, and 135 (73.3%) were male. Among all polyps, 127 (69%) were adenomatous, 31 (16.8%) were hyperplastic, and 24 (13%) were inflammatory. For adenomatous polyps, 31 (24.4%) were observed in patients younger than 50 years, and high-grade dysplasia was observed in 23 (18%) polyps. Among patients with adenomatous polyps, the anatomical location was as follows: 27 (23%) in the cecum/ascending colon, 12 (9%) in the transverse colon, 45 (35%) in the descending/sigmoid colon, 25 (19%) in the rectum, and 18 (14%) at multiple sites. Age >50 years was significantly associated with adenomatous polyps (P\\xa0=\\xa00.03). CONCLUSION: Approximately one-third of adenomatous polyps were detected proximal to the splenic flexure. Although adenomatous polyps were significantly associated with increasing age, 24% were observed in patients younger than 50 years of age. This finding supports the current recommendation to start screening at the age of 45.',\n"," 'Three-dimensional ordered DNA network constructed by a biomarker pair for accurate monitoring of colorectal cancer.Precise and early screening of colorectal cancer (CRC) is one crucial yet challenging task for its treatment, and the analysis of multi-targets of CRC in a single assay with high accuracy is essential for pathological research and clinical diagnosis. Here, a CRC-related biomarker pair, microRNA-211 (miRNA-211) and H(2)S, was detected by constructing a three-dimensional (3D) ordered DNA network. First, trace amount of miRNA-211 could initiate a hybridization chain reaction-based amplification process. A highly ordered 3D DNA network was formed based on the organized assembly of DNA-cube frameworks that were constructed by DNA origamis and Ag nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated inside. In the presence of the H(2)S, Ag NPs within the network can be etched to generate Ag(2)S quantum dots, which could be better visualized in fluorescence in situ cell imaging. Using the 3D DNA ordered network as the sensing platform, it can acquire dual analysis of biomolecule (miRNA-211) and inorganic gas (H(2)S) in vitro, overcoming the limitations of single type of biomarker detection in a single assay. This assay achieved a wide linearity range of H(2)S from 0.05 to 10\\xa0μM, and exhibited a low limit of detection of 4.78\\xa0nM. This strategy allows us to acquire the spatial distributions of H(2)S and miRNA expression levels in living CRC cells simultaneously, providing a highly sensitive and selective tool for early screening and monitoring of CRC.',\n"," 'Protective effect of total flavonoids of Engelhardia roxburghiana Wall. leaves against radiation-induced intestinal injury in mice and its mechanism.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Irradiation-induced intestinal injury (RIII) often occurs during radiotherapy in patients, which would result in abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and even death. Engelhardia roxburghiana Wall. leaves, a traditional Chinese herb, has unique anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, antioxidant, and analgesic effects, is used to treat damp-heat diarrhea, hernia, and abdominal pain, and has the potential to protect against RIII. AIM OF THE STUDY: To explore the protective effects of the total flavonoids of Engelhardia roxburghiana Wall. leaves (TFERL) on RIII and provide some reference for the application of Engelhardia roxburghiana Wall. leaves in the field of radiation protection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect of TFERL on the survival rate of mice was observed after a lethal radiation dose (7.2\\xa0Gy) by ionizing radiation (IR). To better observe the protective effects of the TFERL on RIII, a mice model of RIII induced by IR (13\\xa0Gy) was established. Small intestinal crypts, villi, intestinal stem cells (ISC) and the proliferation of ISC were observed by haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression of genes related to intestinal integrity. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione (GSH), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in the serum of mice were assessed. In vitro, cell models of RIII induced by IR (2, 4, 6, 8\\xa0Gy) were established. Normal human intestinal epithelial cells HIEC-6\\xa0cells were treated with TFERL/Vehicle, and the radiation protective effect of TFERL on HIEC-6\\xa0cells was detected by clone formation assay. DNA damage was detected by comet assay and immunofluorescence assay. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), cell cycle and apoptosis rate were detected by flow cytometry. Oxidative stress, apoptosis and ferroptosis-related proteins were detected by western blot. Finally, the colony formation assay was used to detect the effect of TFERL on the radiosensitivity of colorectal cancer cells. RESULTS: TFERL treatment can increase the survival rate and time of the mice after a lethal radiation dose. In the mice model of RIII induced by IR, TFERL alleviated RIII by reducing intestinal crypt/villi structural damage, increasing the number and proliferation of ISC, and maintaining the integrity of the intestinal epithelium after total abdominal irradiation. Moreover, TFERL promoted the proliferation of irradiated HIEC-6\\xa0cells, and reduced radiation-induced apoptosis and DNA damage. Mechanism studies have found that TFERL promotes the expression of NRF2 and its downstream antioxidant proteins, and silencing NRF2 resulted in the loss of radioprotection by TFERL, suggesting that TFERL exerts radiation protection by activating the NRF2 pathway. Surprisingly, TFERL reduced the number of clones of colon cancer cells after irradiation, suggesting that TFERL can increase the radiosensitivity of colon cancer cells. CONCLUSION: Our data showed that TFERL inhibited oxidative stress, reduced DNA damage, reduced apoptosis and ferroptosis, and improved IR-induced RIII. This study may offer a fresh approach to using Chinese herbs for radioprotection.',\n"," 'Identification of potential bioactive compounds of Passiflora edulis leaf extract against colon adenocarcinoma cells.Plant bioactive compounds such as flavonoids and triterpenes can affect lipid metabolism.

Magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate (MgIG) has hepatoprotective effects, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. The study's aim was to investigate the mechanism underlying the hepatoprotective effects of MgIG against oxaliplatin-induced liver injury. METHODS: A xenografted colorectal cancer mouse model was established with MC38 cells. Mice were given oxaliplatin (6 mg/kg/week) for 5 weeks to mimic oxaliplatin-induced liver injury in vivo. LX-2 human hepatic stellate cell s(HSCs) were employed for in vitro studies. Serological tests, hematoxylin and eosin staining, oil red O staining and transmission electron microscopy were used for histopathological examinations. Real-time PCR, western blotting, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical staining were used to determine Cx43 mRNA or protein levels. Flow cytometry was used to assay reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane. Short hairpin RNA targeting Cx43 was lentivirally transduced in LX-2 cells. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to determine MgIG and metabolite concentration. RESULTS: MgIG (40 mg/kg/day) treatment significantly reduced serum aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels in the mouse model, and alleviated liver pathological changes, including necrosis, sinusoidal expansion, mitochondrial damage, and fibrosis. MgIG reduced the abnormal expression of Cx43 in the mitochondria and nuclei of HSCs. MgIG inhibited the activation of HSCs via reducing ROS generation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and N-cadherin transcription. MgIG's inhibition of HSCs activation was abolished after knockdown of Cx43 in LX-2 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Cx43 mediated MgIG's hepatoprotective effects against oxaliplatin-induced toxicity.\",\n"," 'Toxic profile of marinobufagin from poisonous Amazon toads and antitumoral effects on human colorectal carcinomas.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: South Americans natives have extensively used the toad \"kururu\" to reduce/treat skin infections, cutaneous lesions and sores. They release secretions rich in bufadienolides, polyhydroxy steroids with well-documented cardiotonic and antiproliferative actions, but in vivo antitumoral evaluations in mammals are rare, and toxicological safety has been left in second place. AIMS OF THE STUDY: This investigation used in silico, in vitro and in vivo tools to evaluate acute and subacute toxic effects of marinobufagin and the anticancer action in tumor-bearing mice models. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Initially, in silico toxic predictions were performed, followed by in vitro assays using human and murine normal and tumor lines. Next, acute and subacute studies on mice investigated the behavior, hematological and intestinal transit profile and antitumoral activity of marinobufagin in sarcoma 180- and HCT-116 colorectal carcinoma-transplanted mice for 7 and 15 days, respectively. Ex vivo and in vivo cytogenetic assays in Sarcoma 180 and bone marrow cells and histopathological examinations were also executed. RESULTS: In silico studies revealed ecotoxicological effects on crustaceans (Daphnia sp.), fishes (Pimephales promelas and Oryzias latipes), and algae. A 24-h marinobufagin-induced acute toxicity included signals of central activity, mainly (vocal frenzy, absence of body tonus, increased ventilation, ataxia, and equilibrium loss), and convulsions and death at 10\\xa0mg/kg. The bufadienolide presented effective in vitro cytotoxic action on human lines of colorectal carcinomas in a similar way to ouabain and tumor reduction in marinobufagin-treated SCID-bearing HCT-116 heterotopic xenografts. Animals under subacute nonlethal doses exhibited a decrease in creatinine clearance with normal levels of blood urea, probably as a result of a marinobufagin-induced renal perfusion fall. Nevertheless, only minor morphological side effects were identified in kidneys, livers, hearts and lungs. CONCLUSIONS: Marinobufagin has in vitro and in vivo anticancer action on colorectal carcinoma and mild and reversible alterations in key metabolic organs without direct chemotherapy-induced gastrointestinal effects at subacute exposure, but it causes acute ataxia, equilibrium loss, convulsions and death at higher acute exposure.',\n"," 'Long-term DEHP/MEHP exposure promotes colorectal cancer stemness associated with glycosylation alterations.Plasticizers are considered as environmental pollution released from medical devices and increased potential oncogenic risks in clinical therapy. Our previous studies have shown that long-term exposure to di-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP)/mono-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP) promotes chemotherapeutic drug resistance in colorectal cancer. In this study, we investigated the alteration of glycosylation in colorectal cancer following long-term plasticizers exposure. First, we determined the profiles of cell surface N-glycomes by using mass spectrometry and found out the alterations of α2,8-linkages glycans. Next, we analyzed the correlation between serum DEHP/MEHP levels and ST8SIA6 expression from matched tissues in total 110 colorectal cancer patients. Moreover, clinical specimens and TCGA database were used to analyze the expression of ST8SIA6 in advanced stage of cancer. Finally, we showed that ST8SIA6 regulated stemness in vitro and in vivo. Our results revealed long-term DEHP/MEHP exposure significantly caused cancer patients with poorer survival outcome and attenuated the expression of ST8SIA6 in cancer cells and tissue samples. As expected, silencing of ST8SIA6 promoted cancer stemness and tumorigenicity by upregulating stemness-associated proteins. In addition, the cell viability assay showed enhanced drug resistance in ST8SIA6 silencing cells treated with irinotecan. Besides, ST8SIA6 was downregulated in the advanced stage and positively correlated with tumor recurrence in colorectal cancer. Our results imply that ST8SIA6 potentially plays an important role in oncogenic effects with long-term phthalates exposure.',\n"," 'Comments on \"Global burden of HPV-attributable squamous cell carcinoma of the anus in 2020, according to sex and HIV status: A worldwide analysis\": Prevention of anal squamous cell carcinoma in women: How to move forward: Prevention of anal squamous cell carcinoma in women: How to move forward.nan',\n"," 'Combination of naproxen and a chemically-stable eicosapentaenoic acid analog provide additive tumor protection in Pirc rats.Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Patients with the genetic disorder Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) develop hundreds to thousands of polyps that unless removed by prophylactic colectomy will progress to CRC at an early age. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and the ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), have been evaluated for their chemopreventive potential in delaying CRC onset in high-risk patients. In our study, we determined whether the NSAID, naproxen, alone or in combination with a chemically-stable EPA analog (TP-252), affects tumor formation in the Apc(Pirc) rat model. When compared to control diet, animals fed naproxen or HD TP-252 had 66% and 82% fewer tumors, respectively. However, animals fed a combination of naproxen and HD TP-252, exhibited a 95% reduction in tumor formation and a 98% reduction in tumor volume, respectively. To elucidate potential mechanisms of tumor protection, a comprehensive, targeted lipidomic analysis was performed on colonic mucosa to determine changes in eicosanoid metabolism. Animals receiving TP-252 alone or in combination with naproxen had significantly reduced mucosal levels of proinflammatory ω-6 eicosanoids (PGE(2) , 5-HETE and 14,15-DiHETrE), along with a simultaneous increase in anti-inflammatory EPA-derived ω-3 eicosanoids. A comprehensive lipidomic analysis also uncovered several potential pharmacodynamic (PD) lipid biomarkers, including resolvin E2, 9-HEPE, 12-HEPE and 18-HEPE, that were significantly correlated with tumor protection. Further studies with this drug combination should be focused on dose optimization and the role of EPA-derived lipid mediators in CRC initiation and progression.',\n"," 'Advances in \"adiponcosis\": Insights in the inner mechanisms at the base of adipose and tumour tissues interplay.The epidemic spread of obesity is nowadays recognized as a global health and economic burden, arising great interest in the scientific community. The rate of adult obesity steadily increases concomitantly with the cancer incidence. As has been comprehensively reported, obesity is included among the multiple cancer risk factors and can progressively cause and/or exacerbate certain cancer types, as colorectal and breast cancers. The term adiponcosis was forged precisely to emphasize the interconnection between obesity and cancer onset and progression. The underlying mechanisms of adiponcosis have not been fully elucidated yet, may vary on cancer type, and depend on body fat distribution. It has been proposed that insulin resistance and related chronic hyperinsulinemia, increased insulin-like growth factors production, chronic inflammation or increased bioavailability of steroid hormones could be responsible of cancer hallmarks. Additionally, it has been suggested that adipose tissue-derived hormones, cytokines and adipokines, such as leptin, adiponectin and inflammatory markers, may reflect mechanisms linked to tumorigenesis. This review summarizes the current evidence on pathways, hormones, cytokines and low-chronic inflammation subtending adiponconsis, focusing on breast and colorectal cancers. In addition, we analyzed the lifestyle interventions that could attenuate the driving forces of obesity-related cancer incidence and progression. Moreover, current targets and drugs, their pros and cons, as well as new mechanisms and targets with promising therapeutic potential in cancer are discussed. Depicting this complex interconnection will provide insights for establishing new therapeutic approaches to halt the obesity impacts and thwart cancer onset and progression.',\n"," 'Patrinia villosa treat colorectal cancer by activating PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: At present, the colorectal cancer (CRC) is a malignant tumor of the colon and rectum that is often found at the junction of the two, and it will invade many visceral organs and organizations, causing very serious damage to the body of the patient. Patrinia villosa Juss. (P.V), is a well-known traditional chinese medicine (TCM), and is recorded in the Compendium of Materia Medica as a necessary article for the treatment of intestinal carbuncle. It has been incorporated into traditional cancer treatment prescriptions in modern medicine. While the mechanism of action of P.V in the treatment of CRC remains unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate P.V in treating CRC and clarify the underlying mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was based on Azoxymethane (AOM) combined with the Dextran Sulfate Sodium Salt (DSS)-induced CRC mouse model to clarify the pharmacological effects of P.V. The mechanism of action was found by metabolites and metabolomics. The rationality of metabolomics results was verified through the clinical target database of network pharmacology, and find the upstream and downstream target information of relevant action pathways. Apart from that, the targets of associated pathways were confirmed, and the mechanism of action was made clear, using quantitative PCR (q-PCR) and Western blot. RESULTS: The number and the diameter of tumors were decreased when mice were treated with P.V. P.V group section results showed newly generated cells which improved the degree of colon cell injury. Pathological indicators presented a trend of recovery to normal cells. Compared to the model group, P.V groups had significantly lower levels of the CRC biomarkers CEA, CA19-9, and CA72-4. Through the evaluation of metabolites and metabolomics, it was found that a total of 50 endogenous metabolites had significant changes. Most of these are modulated and recovered after P.V treatment. It alters glycerol phospholipid metabolites, which are closely related to PI3K target, suggesting that P.V can treat CRC though the PI3K target and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. q-PCR and Western blot results also verified that the expression of VEGF, PI3K, Akt, P38, JNK, ERK1/2, TP53, IL-6, TNF-α and Caspase-3 were significantly decreased, whereas that of Caspase-9 was increased after treatment. CONCLUSION: P.V is dependent on PI3K target and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway for CRC treatment.',\n"," 'Oncogenic signaling is coupled to colorectal cancer cell differentiation state.Colorectal cancer progression is intrinsically linked to stepwise deregulation of the intestinal differentiation trajectory. In this process, sequential mutations of APC, KRAS, TP53, and SMAD4 enable oncogenic signaling and establish the hallmarks of cancer. Here, we use mass cytometry of isogenic human colon organoids and patient-derived cancer organoids to capture oncogenic signaling, cell phenotypes, and differentiation states in a high-dimensional single-cell map. We define a differentiation axis in all tumor progression states from normal to cancer. Our data show that colorectal cancer driver mutations shape the distribution of cells along the differentiation axis. In this regard, subsequent mutations can have stem cell promoting or restricting effects. Individual nodes of the cancer cell signaling network remain coupled to the differentiation state, regardless of the presence of driver mutations. We use single-cell RNA sequencing to link the (phospho-)protein signaling network to transcriptomic states with biological and clinical relevance. Our work highlights how oncogenes gradually shape signaling and transcriptomes during tumor progression.',\n"," 'Therapeutic effects of natural polyphenols on colorectal adenomas: Focus on preclinical studies (Review).Colorectal adenoma (CRA) is a premalignant lesion of colorectal cancer. The current treatment is surgical resection, but CRA is prone to recurrence, and there is no safe and effective drug to prevent adenoma recurrence and canceration. Recent studies have shown that natural compounds in plants have favorable antitumor effects. According to preclinical studies, natural polyphenols can regulate different signal pathways and targets to play a role in the treatment of CRA, which is closely related to its inhibition of proliferation, induction of apoptosis, inhibition of inflammation and oxidative stress, and regulation of intestinal flora. Natural polyphenols are potential candidates for CRA therapy due to their remarkable efficacy and safety. In the present review, attention was paid to the experimental research progress of natural polyphenols extracted from numerous plants in the treatment of CRA in the last 10\\xa0years. The present review provided new guidance for the study of CRA, clarified the therapeutic role of polyphenols in CRA, and evaluated for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, the therapeutic potential of natural polyphenols to treat CRA by targeting multiple genes and signal pathways and epigenetic modification.',\n"," 'mHealth Coping Skills Training for Symptom Management (mCOPE) for colorectal cancer patients in early to mid-adulthood: Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) patients in early to mid-adulthood (≤50 years) are challenged by high symptom burden (i.e., pain, fatigue, distress) and age-related stressors (e.g., managing family, work). Cognitive behavioral theory (CBT)-based coping skills training interventions reduce symptoms and improve quality of life in cancer patients. However, traditional CBT-based interventions are not accessible to these patients (e.g., in-person sessions, during work day), nor designed to address symptoms within the context of this stage of life. We developed a mobile health (mHealth) coping skills training program for pain, fatigue and distress (mCOPE) for CRC patients in early to mid-adulthood. We utilize a randomized controlled trial to test the extent to which mCOPE reduces pain, fatigue and distress (multiple primary outcomes) and improves quality of life and symptom self-efficacy (secondary outcomes). METHODS/DESIGN: Patients (N\\xa0=\\xa0160) ≤50 years with CRC endorsing pain, fatigue and/or distress are randomized 1:1 to mCOPE or standard care. mCOPE is a five-session CBT-based coping skills training program (e.g., relaxation, activity pacing, cognitive restructuring) that was adapted for CRC patients in early to mid-adulthood. mCOPE utilizes mHealth technology (e.g., videoconference, mobile app) to deliver coping skills training, capture symptom and skills use data, and provide personalized support and feedback. Self-report assessments are completed at baseline, post-treatment (5-8 weeks post-baseline; primary endpoint), and 3- and 6-months later. CONCLUSIONS: mCOPE is innovative and potentially impactful for CRC patients in early to mid-adulthood. Hypothesis confirmation would demonstrate initial efficacy of a mHealth cognitive behavioral intervention to reduce symptom burden in younger CRC patients.',\n"," 'From adenoma to CRC stages: the oral-gut microbiome axis as a source of potential microbial and metabolic biomarkers of malignancy.BACKGROUND: Approximately 95% of Colorectal cancers (CRC) consist of adenocarcinomas originating from colonic Adenomatous polyps (AP). Increasing importance in CRC occurrence and progression has been attributed to the gut microbiota; however, a huge proportion of microorganisms inhabit the human digestive system. So, to comprehensively study the microbial spatial variations and their role in CRC progression, from AP to the different CRC phases, a holistic vision is imperative, including the simultaneous evaluation of multiple niches from the gastrointestinal system. Through an integrated approach, we identified potential microbial and metabolic biomarkers, able to discriminate human CRC from AP and/or also the different Tumor node metastasis (TNM) staging. In addition, as the microbiota contributes to the production of essential metabolic products detectable in fecal samples, we analysed and compared metabolites obtained from CRC and AP patients by using a Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) approach. METHODS: In this observational study, saliva, tissue and stool samples from 61 patients, have been collected, including 46 CRC and 15 AP patients, age and sex-matched, undergoing surgery in 2018 at the Careggi University Hospital (Florence, Italy). First, the microbiota in the three-district between CRC and AP patients has been characterized, as well as in different CRC TNM stages. Subsequently, proton NMR spectroscopy has been used in combination with multivariate and univariate statistical approaches, to define the fecal metabolic profile of a restricted group of CRC and AP patients. RESULTS: CRC patients display a different profile of tissue and fecal microbiota with respect to AP patients. Significant differences have been observed in CRC tissue microbial clades, with a rise of the Fusobacterium genus. In addition, significant taxa increase at the genus level has been observed in stool samples of CRC patients. Furthermore, Fusobacterium found in intestinal tissue has been positively correlated with fecal Parvimonas, for the first time. Moreover, as predicted by metagenomics pathway analysis, a significant increase of lactate (p=0.037) has been observed in the CRC fecal metabolic profiles, and positively correlated with Bifidobacterium (p=0.036). Finally, minor bacterial differences in CRC patients at stage T2 (TNM classification) have been detected, with a raise of the Spirochaetota phylum in CRC samples, with a slight increase of the Alphaproteobacteria class in fecal samples. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest the importance of microbiota communities and oncometabolites in CRC development. Further studies on CRC/AP management with a focus on CRC assessment are needed to investigate novel microbial-related diagnostic tools aimed to improve therapeutic interventions.',\n"," 'Role of the voltage‑gated sodium channel Nav1.6 in glioma and candidate drugs screening.Gliomas remain a clinical challenge, common and fatal. Treatment of glioblastoma remains elusive, and researchers have focused on discovering new mechanisms and drugs. It has been well established that the expression of voltage‑gated sodium channels (VGSCs) is abnormally increased in numerous malignancies and, in general, is rarely expressed in the corresponding normal tissues. This suggests that ion channel activity appears to be associated with malignant progression of tumors. VGSCs remain largely unknown as to how their activity leads to an increase in cancer cell activity or invasiveness. Certain sodium ion channel subtypes (for instance, Nav1.5 and Nav1.7) are associated with metastasis and invasion in cancers including breast and colorectal cancers. A previous study by the authors explored the expression of certain ion channels in glioma, but there are few studies related to Nav1.6. The current study aimed to elucidate the expression and role of Nav1.6 in glioma and to screen potential drugs for the treatment of glioma by virtual screening and drug sensitivity analysis. Nav1.6 relative expression of mRNA and protein was determined by reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR and western blot analysis. Cell proliferation was determined by Cell Counting Kit‑8 assay. Cell migration was assessed by cellular wound healing assay. Cell invasion and apoptosis were detected by Transwell cell invasion assay and flow cytometry. Last but not least, FDA‑approved drugs were screened using virtual screening, molecular docking and NCI‑60 drug sensitivity analyses based on the expression and structure of Nav1.6. In glioma cells, Nav1.6 was significantly upregulated and expressed mostly in the cytoplasm and cell membrane; its expression was positively correlated with pathological grade. A172 and U251 cells exhibited reduced proliferation, migration and invasion when Nav1.6 expression was knocked down, and apoptosis was increased. TNF‑α (100\\xa0pg/ml) acting on glioma cells was found to upregulate the expression level of Nav1.6, and TNF‑α was involved in the process of Nav1.6 promoting malignant progression of glioma. Finally, certain FDA‑approved drugs were identified by virtual screening and drug sensitivity analysis. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated the expression and role of Nav1.6 in glioma and identified several FDA‑approved drugs that are highly correlated with Nav1.6 and could be candidate drugs for patients with glioma.',\n"," 'A review of nemorosone: Chemistry and biological properties.Nemorosone is a bicyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinol derivative originally isolated from Clusia spp. and it can be obtained through chemical synthesis employing different synthetic strategies. Since its discovery, it has attracted great attention both from a biological and chemical viewpoint. In the present article, we attempted to review various chemical and biological topics around nemorosone, with an emphasis on its antiproliferative activities. For this purpose, relevant data was collected from different scientific databases including Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus and ISI Web of Knowledge. This natural compound has shown activity against several types of malignancies such as leukemia, human colorectal, pancreatic, and breast cancer because it modulates multiple molecular pathways. Nemorosone has both cytostatic and cytotoxic activity and it also seems to induce apoptosis and ferroptosis. Additionally, it has antimicrobial capabilities against Gram-positive bacteria and parasites belonging to genus Leishmania. Its promising antiproliferative pre-clinical effects deserve further attention for anticancer and anti-parasitic drug development and translation to the clinic.',\n"," 'Structure optimization of an F-indole-chalcone (FC116) on 4-methoxyphenyl group and therapeutic potential against colorectal cancers with low cytotoxicity.Advanced metastatic colorectal cancers (CRCs) are regarded as a challenge in clinical cancer therapy. Our previous studies have demonstrated that a representative fluoro-substituted indole-chalcone (FC116), was obtained to display highly potent activity against CRC using multiple in vitro and in vivo mouse models by targeting microtubules. However, several problems, such as low dose tolerance and highly toxic to the brain and colon, low solubility unsuitable for intravenous (i.v.) administration, are still existed and limit further development. Herein, we developed two series of FC116 derivatives on the 4-methoxyphenyl group by a structure-based design strategy. Among them, FC11619 with an amino terminus maintained the in vitro cytotoxicity against HCT-116 CRC in a low nanomolar range. This compound could induce G2/M phase arrest via regulating cyclin B1 expression, produce excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), and target tubulin in CRC cells. In vivo, FC11619 significantly suppressed tumor growth, achieving 65.3 and 73.4 % at doses of 5 and 10\\xa0mg/kg/d (i.v., 21 d), which were much better than 54.1% of Taxol at 7\\xa0mg/kg. In addition, this compound showed better in vivo tolerance compared to that of FC116 (only 3\\xa0mg/kg tolerance, intraperitoneal, i.p.), and no major organ-related toxicity, especially no apparent degenerated neurons, intestinal obstruction in clinical Taxol standard therapy. Taken together, the 4-amino-substitutedphenyl indole-chalcones represent lead compounds as chemotherapy of CRC for further drug development in this field.',\n"," \"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the early-onset colorectal cancer.The COVID19 pandemic has affected the spectrum of cancer care worldwide. Early onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC) is defined as diagnosis below the age of 50. Patients with EOCRC faced multiple challenges during the COVID19 pandemic and in some institutions it jeopardized cancer diagnosis and care delivery. Our study aims to identify the clinicopathological features and outcomes of patients with EOCRC in our Centre during the first wave of the pandemic in comparison with the same period in 2019 and 2021. Patients with EOCRC visited for the first time at Vall d'Hebron University Hospital in Spain from the 1st March to 31st August of 2019, 2020 and 2021 were included in the analysis. 177 patients with EOCRC were visited for the first time between 2019 and 2021, of which 90 patients met the inclusion criteria (2019: 30 patients, 2020: 29 patients, 2021: 31 patients). Neither differences in frequency nor in stage at diagnosis or at first visit during the given periods were observed. Of note, indication of systemic therapy in the adjuvant or metastatic setting was not altered. Days to treatment initiation and enrollment in clinical trials in this subpopulation was not affected due to the COVID-19 outbreak.\",\n"," \"Berberine is a suppressor of Hedgehog signaling cascade in colorectal cancer.BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a malignant affliction that burdens people globally. Overactivated Hedgehog signal is highly implicated in CRC pathogenesis. Phytochemical berberine exerts strong potency on CRC, with molecular mechanism elusive. PURPOSE: We sought to study berberine's anti-CRC action and explore its underlying mechanism based on Hedgehog signaling cascade. METHODS: In CRC HCT116 cells and SW480 cells treated with berberine, the proliferation, migration, invasion, clonogenesis, apoptosis and cell cycle were measured, with determination of Hedgehog signaling pathway activity. Following establishment of mouse model of HCT116 xenograft tumor, the efficacies of berberine on carcinogenesis, pathological manifestation and malignant phenotypes of CRC were examined, with analysis of Hedgehog signaling axis in HCT116 xenograft tumor tissues. Additionally, toxicological study of berberine was conducted on zebrafish. RESULTS: Berberine was discovered to suppress the proliferation, migration, invasion and clonogenesis of HCT116 cells and SW480 cells. Furthermore, berberine caused cell apoptosis and blockaded cell cycle at phase G(0)/G(1) in CRC cells, with dampened Hedgehog signaling cascade. In HCT116 xenograft tumor of nude mice, berberine inhibited tumor growth, alleviated pathological score, and promoted apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in tumor tissues, through constraining Hedgehog signaling. The toxicological study of berberine on zebrafish indicated that berberine incurred damage to the liver and heart of zebrafish at high dosage and prolonged administration. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, berberine may inhibit the malignant phenotypes of CRC through diminishing Hedgehog signaling cascade. However, the potential adverse reactions should be taken into account upon abuse of berberine.\",\n"," \"Exploring the anti-metastatic effects of Astragalus mongholicus Bunge-Curcuma aromatica Salisb. on colorectal cancer: A network-based metabolomics and pharmacology approach.BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignancy that can significantly diminish patients' quality of life. Astragalus mongholicus Bunge-Curcuma aromatica Salisb. (AC) is an ancient Chinese medicinal combination used for the treatment of CRC. However, the core ingredients and targets involved in regulating lipid and amino acid metabolism in CRC remain unknown. We aimed to explore the key components and pharmacological mechanisms of AC in the treatment of CRC through a comprehensive analysis of network metabolomics, network pharmacology, molecular docking, and biological methods. METHODS: Ultra-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (MS) was used for quality control. Gas chromatography/MS and liquid chromatography/MS were used to detect metabolites in the feces and serum of CRC mice. A network pharmacology approach and molecular docking were used to explore the potential genes involved in the CRC-target-component network. The effect of AC on tumor immunity was investigated using flow cytometry and polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: AC, high-dose AC, and 5-fluorouracil treatment reduced liver metastasis and tumor mass. Compared with the CRC group, 2 amino acid metabolites and 14 lipid metabolites (LPC, PC, PE) were upregulated and 15 amino acid metabolites and 9 lipid metabolites (TG, PE, PG, 12-HETE) were downregulated. Subsequently, through network analysis, four components and six hub genes were identified for molecular docking. AC can bind to ALDH1B1, ALDH2, CAT, GOT2, NOS3, and ASS1 through beta-Elemene, canavanine, betaine, and chrysanthemaxanthin. AC promoted the responses of M1 macrophages and down-regulated the responses of M2 macrophages, Treg cells, and the gene expression of related factors. CONCLUSION: Our research showed that AC effectively inhibited the growth and metastasis of tumors and regulated metabolism and immunity in a CRC mouse model. Thus, AC may be an effective alternative treatment option for CRC.\",\n"," \"The association of social vulnerability with colorectal enhanced recovery program failure.BACKGROUND: Enhanced recovery programs (ERPs) improve outcomes, but over 20\\xa0% of patients fail ERP and the contribution of social vulnerability is unknown. This study aimed to characterize the association between social vulnerability and ERP adherence and failure. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of colorectal surgery patients between 2015 and 2020 utilizing ACS-NSQIP data. Patients who failed ERP (LOS\\xa0>\\xa06\\xa0days) were compared to patients not failing ERP. The CDC's social vulnerability index (SVI) was used to assess social vulnerability. RESULT: 273 of 1191 patients (22.9\\xa0%) failed ERP. SVI was a significant predictor of ERP failure (OR 4.6, 95\\xa0% CI 1.3-16.8) among those with >70\\xa0% ERP component adherence. SVI scores were significantly higher among patients non-adherent with 3 key ERP components: preoperative block (0.58 vs. 0.51, p\\xa0<\\xa00.01), early diet (0.57 vs. 0.52, p\\xa0=\\xa00.04) and early foley removal (0.55 vs. 0.50, p\\xa0<\\xa00.01). CONCLUSIONS: Higher social vulnerability was associated with non-adherence to 3 key ERP components as well as ERP failure among those who were adherent with >70\\xa0% of ERP components. Social vulnerability needs to be recognized, addressed, and included in efforts to further improve ERPs. KEY MESSAGE: Social vulnerability is associated with non-adherence to enhanced recovery components and ERP failure among those with high ERP adherence. Social vulnerability needs to be addressed in efforts to improve ERPs.\",\n"," 'The role of unpaired image-to-image translation for stain color normalization in colorectal cancer histology classification.BACKGROUND: Histological assessment of colorectal cancer (CRC) tissue is a crucial and demanding task for pathologists. Unfortunately, manual annotation by trained specialists is a burdensome operation, which suffers from problems like intra- and inter-pathologist variability. Computational models are revolutionizing the Digital Pathology field, offering reliable and fast approaches for challenges like tissue segmentation and classification. With this respect, an important obstacle to overcome consists in stain color variations among different laboratories, which can decrease the performance of classifiers. In this work, we investigated the role of Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation (UI2IT) models for stain color normalization in CRC histology and compared to classical normalization techniques for Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) images. METHODS: Five Deep Learning normalization models based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) belonging to the UI2IT paradigm have been thoroughly compared to realize a robust stain color normalization pipeline. To avoid the need for training a style transfer GAN between each pair of data domains, in this paper we introduce the concept of training by exploiting a meta-domain, which contains data coming from a wide variety of laboratories. The proposed framework enables a huge saving in terms of training time, by allowing to train a single image normalization model for a target laboratory. To prove the applicability of the proposed workflow in the clinical practice, we conceived a novel perceptive quality measure, which we defined as Pathologist Perceptive Quality (PPQ). The second stage involved the classification of tissue types in CRC histology, where deep features extracted from Convolutional Neural Networks have been exploited to realize a Computer-Aided Diagnosis system based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM). To prove the reliability of the system on new data, an external validation set composed of N\\xa0=\\xa015,857 tiles has been collected at IRCCS Istituto Tumori \"Giovanni Paolo II\". RESULTS: The exploitation of a meta-domain consented to train normalization models that allowed achieving better classification results than normalization models explicitly trained on the source domain. PPQ metric has been found correlated to quality of distributions (Fréchet Inception Distance - FID) and to similarity of the transformed image to the original one (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity - LPIPS), thus showing that GAN quality measures introduced in natural image processing tasks can be linked to pathologist evaluation of H&E images. Furthermore, FID has been found correlated to accuracies of the downstream classifiers. The SVM trained on DenseNet201 features allowed to obtain the highest classification results in all configurations. The normalization method based on the fast variant of CUT (Contrastive Unpaired Translation), FastCUT, trained with the meta-domain paradigm, allowed to achieve the best classification result for the downstream task and, correspondingly, showed the highest FID on the classification dataset. CONCLUSIONS: Stain color normalization is a difficult but fundamental problem in the histopathological setting. Several measures should be considered for properly assessing normalization methods, so that they can be introduced in the clinical practice. UI2IT frameworks offer a powerful and effective way to perform the normalization process, providing realistic images with proper colorization, unlike traditional normalization methods that introduce color artifacts. By adopting the proposed meta-domain framework, the training time can be reduced, and the accuracy of downstream classifiers can be increased.',\n"," 'Combination of vitamin D and probiotics inhibits chemically induced colorectal carcinogenesis in Wistar rats.The modulation of inflammatory elements, cell differentiation and proliferation by vitamin D and the role of probiotics in the intestinal microbiota and immunogenic response have sparked interest in the application of both in chemotherapeutics and chemoprevention of colorectal tumors. AIMS: The present study aimed to investigate the effects of isolated and/or combined treatment of vitamin D3 and probiotics on colorectal carcinogenesis. MAIN METHODS: Pre-neoplastic lesions were induced with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine in the colon of Wistar rats, which were treated with probiotics and/or vitamin D in three different approaches (simultaneous, pre-, and post-treatment). We investigated the frequency of aberrant crypt foci (ACF) and aberrant crypt (AC) in the distal colon, fecal microbiome composition, gene and protein expression through immunohistochemical and RT-PCR assays, and general toxicity through water consumption and weight gain monitoring. KEY FINDINGS: Results confirm the systemic safety of treatments, and show a protective effect of vitamin D and probiotics in all approaches studied, as well as in combined treatments, with predominance of different bacterial phyla compared to controls. Treated groups show different levels of Nrf2, GST, COX2, iNOS, β-catenin and PCNA expression. SIGNIFICANCE: These experimental conditions explore the combination of vitamin D and probiotics supplementation at low doses over pathways involved in distinct stages of colorectal carcinogenesis, with results supporting its application in prevention and long-term strategies.',\n"," 'B13, a well-tolerated inhibitor of hedgehog pathway, exhibited potent anti-tumor effects against colorectal carcinoma in vitro and in vivo.Abnormal activation of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway mediates the genesis and progression of various tumors [1]. Currently, three drugs targeting the Hh signaling component Smoothened (Smo) have been marketed for the clinical treatment of basal cell tumors or acute myeloid leukemia. However, drug resistance is a common problem in those drugs, so the study of Smo inhibitors that can overcome drug resistance has important guiding significance for clinical adjuvant drugs. MTT assay, clone formation assay and EdU assay were used to detect the proliferation inhibitory activity of the drugs on tumor cells. The effect of B13 on cell cycle and apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry. An acute toxicity test was used to detect the toxicity of B13 in vivo, and xenograft tumor model was used to detect the efficacy of B13 in vivo. The binding of B13 to Smo was studied by BODIPY-cyclopamine competitive binding assay and molecular docking. The effect of B13 on the expression and localization of downstream target gene Gli1/2 of Smo was investigated by Western Blot and immunofluorescence assay. Smo(D473H) mutant cell line was constructed to study the effect of B13 against drug resistance. (1) B13 had the strongest inhibitory activity against colorectal cancer cells. (2) B13 can effectively inhibit the clone formation and EdU positive rate of colon cancer cells. (3) B13 can block the cell cycle in the G2/M phase and cell apoptosis. (4) B13 has low toxicity in vivo, and its efficacy in vivo is better than that of the Vismodegib. (5) Molecular docking and BODIPY-cyclopamine experiments showed that B13 could bind to Smo protein. (6) B13 can inhibit the protein expression of Gli1, the downstream of Smo, and inhibit its entry into the nucleus. (7) B13 could inhibit the expression of Gli1 in the HEK293 cells with Smo(D473H), and the molecular docking results showed that B13 could bind Smo(D473H) protein. B13 with the best anti-tumor activity was screened out by MTT assay. In vitro, pharmacodynamics experiments showed that B13 could effectively inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of colorectal cancer cells, induce cell cycle arrest, and induce cell apoptosis. In vivo pharmacodynamics experiments showed that B13 was superior to Vismodegib in antitumor activity and had low toxicity in vivo. Mechanism studies have shown that B13 can bind Smo protein, inhibit the expression of downstream Gli1 and its entry into the nucleus. Notably, B13 overcomes resistance caused by Smo(D473H) mutations.',\n"," 'The mechanisms underlying the enrichment and action of glypican-1-positive exosomes in colorectal cancer cells.BACKGROUND: Glypican-1 (GPC1) is overexpressed in several tumors, and GPC1(+) exosomes have shown the potential to predict early colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the mechanisms underlying the enrichment and action of GPC1(+) exosomes in CRC remain unknown. METHODS: The expression of slit guidance ligand 2 (SLIT2), hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α/2α, and GPC1 in clinical CRC tissues was detected using immunohistochemistry and western blot. Exosomes were isolated from the supernatants of CRC cell cultures. The effects of SLIT2, hypoxia, heparin, and phospholipase C (PLC) on exosomal GPC1 expression and GPC1(+) exosome enrichment in CRC cells were analyzed with western blot and flow cytometry. CRC cell proliferation was assessed with MTT and colony formation assays. Co-immunoprecipitation was used to detect the binding of GPC1 and SLIT2 in SW480 cells. Nude mice were subcutaneously inoculated with SW480 cells with different treatments. The Wnt signaling was detected. RESULTS: SLIT2 was poorly expressed and GPC1, HIF-1α, and HIF-2α were highly expressed in human CRC tissues. SLIT2 in CRC cells inhibited GPC1(+) exosome enrichment and exosomal GPC1 expression. PLC and heparin increased GPC1(+) exosome enrichment in CRC cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Hypoxia increased the enrichment of GPC1(+) exosomes in CRC cells depending on HIF-2α expression. GPC1(+) exosomes stimulated CRC cell proliferation and xenograft tumor growth through activation of Wnt signaling. CONCLUSIONS: GPC1(+) exosome enrichment is related to PLC and heparin. Hypoxia increases the enrichment of GPC1(+) exosomes in CRC cells by activating HIF-2α and downregulating SLIT2. GPC1(+) exosomes further drive CRC progression by activating Wnt signaling.',\n"," 'Label-free MIP-SERS biosensor for sensitive detection of colorectal cancer biomarker.Early diagnosis of colorectal cancer can significantly improve the overall survival rate of patients, thus selective and sensitive detection of biomarkers in serum samples is vital for early detection and dynamic monitoring of cancer. Nucleoside diphosphate kinase NM23-H2 (NDKB) is an important biomarker and therapeutic target for the diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, a label-free and ultrasensitive biosensor for NDKB protein markers is presented for the first time, combining the characteristic capture selectivity of molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) and the ultrasensitivity of surface-enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) technique. The imprinted cavity serves as the only channel for Raman reporter to approach the SERS substrate, providing highly complementary non-covalent binding sites that selectively capture the target protein based on ionic, hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic interactions. Specific recognition of the NDKB protein will perfectly fill the imprinted cavity, which makes it difficult for the Raman reporter to get close to the SERS substrate, and the Raman signal decreases significantly, while the proteins of other structural sizes can not match the imprinted cavity. Through the change of the Raman signal, the proposed biosensor can realize the ultra-sensitive detection of NDKB, and the limit of detection (LOD) is 0.82\\xa0pg/mL. Compared with the traditional immunoassay technology, this combined approach with the advantages of low cost, fast response, high sensitivity and selectivity, provides clinical application potential for the early diagnosis of CRC.',\n"," 'Oxidative stress-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis induced by the acaricide, fenpyroximate, on cultured human colon cancer HCT 116 cells.Fenpyroximate (FEN) is an acaricide that inhibits mitochondrial electron transport at the NADH-coenzyme Q oxidoreductase (complex I). The present study was designed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underling FEN toxicity on cultured human colon carcinoma cells (HCT116). Our data showed that FEN induced HCT116 cell mortality in a concentration dependent manner. FEN arrested cell cycle in G0/G1 phase and increased DNA damage as assessed by comet assay. Induction of apoptosis was confirmed in HCT116 cells exposed to FEN by AO-EB staining and Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining assay. Moreover, FEN induced a loss in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), increased p53 and Bax mRNA expression and decreased bcl2 mRNA level. An increase in caspase 9 and caspase 3 activities was also detected. All toghether, these data suggest that FEN induce apoptosis in HCT116 cells via mitochondrial pathway. To check the implication of oxidative stress in FEN-induced cell toxicity, we examined the oxidative stress statue in HCT116 cells exposed to FEN and we tested the effect of a powerful antioxidant, N-acetylcystein (NAC), on FEN-caused toxicity. It was observed that FEN enhanced ROS generation and MDA levels and disturbed SOD and CAT activities. Besides, cell treatment with NAC significantly protected cells from mortality, DNA damage, loss of MMP, and caspase 3 activity induced by FEN. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing that FEN induced mitochondrial apoptosis via ROS generation and oxidative stress.',\n"," 'Surgical efficacy and learning curves of laparoscopic complete mesocolic excision with intracorporeal anastomosis for right-sided colon cancer: A retrospective two-center cohort study.BACKGROUND: There is a potential benefit on long-term outcomes following complete mesocolic excision (CME) for right-sided colon cancer when compared to conventional colectomy. This study aims to analyze the learning curve and short-term outcomes of laparoscopic CME with intracorporeal anastomosis (ICA) for right-sided colon cancer in the hands of experienced colorectal surgeons. METHODS: A two-center cohort study of consecutive patients undergoing right-sided colectomy from September 2021 to May 2022 at two tertiary colorectal centers in Denmark. Learning curves of surgical time were estimated using a cumulative sum analysis (CUSUM). RESULTS: A total of 61 patients were included. According to the CUSUM analysis, 32 cases were needed to obtain a peak in operative time, resulting in a decrease in time consumption (group 1/learning phase: 217.2\\u2009min [SD 53.6] and group 2/plateau phase 191.6\\u2009min [SD 45.1], p\\u2009=\\u20090.05).

CONCLUSION: The learning curve of laparoscopic CME with ICA for right-sided colon cancer demonstrated that 32 cases were needed to obtain a plateau phase expressed by operative time.',\n"," \"Mediators of county-level racial and economic privilege in cancer screening.BACKGROUND: Area-level social determinants of health (SDoH) impact access to cancer care and prevention. Little is known about the factors that underlie the impact of residential privilege on county-level cancer screening uptake. METHODS: Population-based cross-sectional study examining county-level data was obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's PLACES database, American Community Survey and the County Health Rankings and Roadmap database. The Index of Concentration of Extremes (ICE), a validated measure of racial and economic privilege, was examined relative to county-level rates of US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guideline-concordant screening for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers. Generalized structural equation modeling was used to determine the indirect and direct effects of ICE on cancer screening uptake. RESULTS: Across 3142 counties, county-level cancer screening rates demonstrated geographical variation ranging from 54.0% to 81.8% for breast cancer screening, from 39.8% to 74.4% for colorectal cancer screening, and from 69.9% to 89.7% for cervical cancer screening. Of note, cancer screening rates for breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer all increased from lower (ICE-Q1) to higher (ICE-Q4) privileged areas (breast: Q1\\u2009=\\u200971.0% vs. Q4\\u2009=\\u200972.2%; colorectal: Q1\\u2009=\\u200959.4% vs. Q4\\u2009=\\u200965.0%; cervical: Q1\\u2009=\\u200983.3% vs. Q4\\u2009=\\u200985.2%; all p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Mediation analysis revealed that the observed disparities between ICE and cancer screening uptake were explained by mediators such as poverty status, lack of health insurance or employment, urban-rural location and access to primary care physicians that accounted for 64% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 61%-67%), 85% (95% CI: 80%-89%), and 74% (95% CI: 71%-77%) of the effect on breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer screening, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In this cross-sectional study, the association between racial and economic privilege on USPSTF-recommended cancer screening was complex and influenced by an interplay of sociodemographic, geographical, and structural factors. Understanding the underlying area-level SDoH that mediate disparities in cancer prevention strategies can help focus interventions to improve equity in cancer prevention.\",\n"," 'Comprehensive pan-cancer analysis identifies centromere-associated protein E as a novel prognostic and immunological biomarker in human tumors.Centromere-associated protein E (CENP-E), a core component of the kinetochore, mediates chromosome congression and spindle microtubule capture during mitosis. Partial experimental evidence has illustrated the carcinogenic effects of CENPE in tumors, but the corresponding pan-cancer analysis of CENPE still lacking. Based on public databases, including the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), and Human Protein Atlas (HPA), we take an array of bioinformatics methods to investigate the potential oncogenic roles of CENPE. Then, we validated CENPE, cell cycle-related proteins, and immune checkpoint molecule findings expression in clinical colon cancer samples by western blot. Our results showed that CENPE was up-regulated in almost all tumors, and the expression level of CENPE was associated with worse overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) in patients. The strong relationship between CENPE with gene mutation and MMR has also been validated. Moreover, CENPE gene expression was positively correlated with immune checkpoint molecular, and reversely correlated with infiltration levels of most immune cells. In the human colon cancer tissues, the expression of CENPE, cell cycle-related proteins, and immune checkpoint molecules were significantly higher than in the adjacent normal tissues. Our results indicated that CENPE can function as an oncogene in various cancers, and may be regarded as a promising prognostic and diagnostic biomarker in cancer treatment.',\n"," \"The hereditary N363K POLE exonuclease mutant extends PPAP tumor spectrum to glioblastomas by causing DNA damage and aneuploidy in addition to increased mismatch mutagenicity.The exonuclease domain of DNA polymerases epsilon's catalytic subunit (POLE) removes misincorporated nucleotides, called proofreading. POLE-exonuclease mutations cause colorectal- and endometrial cancers with an extreme burden of single nucleotide substitutions. We recently reported that particularly the hereditary POLE exonuclease mutation N363K predisposes in addition to aggressive giant cell glioblastomas. We knocked-in this mutation homozygously into human cell lines and compared its properties to knock-ins of the likewise hereditary POLE L424V mutation and to a complete proofreading-inactivating mutation (exo-null). We found that N363K cells have higher mutation rates as both L424V- or exo-null mutant cells. In contrast to L424V cells, N363K cells expose a growth defect, replication stress and DNA damage. In non-transformed cells, these burdens lead to aneuploidy but macroscopically normal nuclei. In contrast, transformed N363K cells phenocopy the enlarged and disorganized nuclei of giant cell glioblastomas. Taken together, our data characterize a POLE exonuclease domain mutant that not only causes single nucleotide hypermutation, but in addition DNA damage and chromosome instability, leading to an extended tumor spectrum. Our results expand the understanding of the polymerase exonuclease domain and suggest that an assessment of both the mutational potential and the genetic instability might refine classification and treatment of POLE-mutated tumors.\",\n"," 'A comparison of the efficacy and safety of natural orifice specimen extraction and conventional laparoscopic surgery in patients with sigmoid colon/high rectal cancer.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of natural orifice specimen extraction surgery (NOSES) compared to conventional laparoscopic radical resection in the treatment of patients with sigmoid colon/high rectal cancer. METHODS: The control group (n\\u2009=\\u200962) underwent traditional laparoscopic radical resection, and the observation group (n\\u2009=\\u200962) underwent transanal NOSES laparoscopic radical resection. The operation length; amount of bleeding; number of lymph node dissections and days of hospitalization after surgery; visual pain scores on the first and third days after surgery; first leaving bed, anal exhaust, eating a liquid diet, and effective sleep times; and the postoperative complications (abdominal or incision infection or anastomotic fistula) of the two groups of patients were compared and analyzed. RESULTS: The effective sleep time of the observation group on the first day after the operation was 12.3\\u2009±\\u20092.9\\u2009h, which was longer than that of the control group (10.6\\u2009±\\u20093.2\\u2009h), and the difference was statistically significant (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). The pain degree of the two groups on the third day after the operation was lower than that on the first day, and the pain score of the observation group was lower than that of the control group (2.0\\u2009±\\u20091.0 vs. 3.2\\u2009±\\u20091.2, p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). The postoperative hospital stay in the observation group was significantly shorter than that in the control group (9.7\\u2009±\\u20092.3 vs. 11.2\\u2009±\\u20092.6, p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). The incidence of postoperative complications in the observation group was significantly lower than that in the control group (3.2% vs. 12.9%, p\\u2009=\\u20090.048). In addition, it was found that the first leaving bed, anal exhaust and liquid diet times in the observation group were significantly shorter than those in the control group (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic radical resection NOSES in patients with sigmoid colon cancer or high rectal cancer leads to lower postoperative pain and longer sleep time than in patients who undergo traditional laparoscopic radical surgery. The complication rate of this procedure is low, and the curative effect is safe and positive.',\n"," \"Association between the environmental quality index and textbook outcomes among Medicare beneficiaries undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer (CRC).BACKGROUND: Quality of cancer care received by individuals may be influenced by environmental factors resulting in inequalities within the healthcare system. We sought to investigate the association between the Environmental Quality Index (EQI) and achievement of textbook outcomes (TOs) among Medicare beneficiaries who underwent surgical resection for colorectal cancer (CRC). METHODS: Patients diagnosed with CRC from 2004 to 2015 were identified using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database and merged with the US Environmental Protection Agency's EQI data. A high EQI category indicated poor environmental quality, whereas a low EQI indicated better environmental conditions. RESULTS: Among 40\\u2009939 patients, 33\\u2009699 (82.3%) were diagnosed with colon cancer, 7240 (17.7%) were diagnosed with rectal cancer, and 652 (1.6%) were diagnosed with both cancers. Median age was 76 years old (interquartile range: 70-82 years) with roughly half of patients being female (n\\u2009=\\u200922\\u2009033, 53.8%). Most patients self-reported as White (n\\u2009=\\u200932\\u2009404, 79.2%) and resided in the West region of the United States (n\\u2009=\\u200920\\u2009308, 49.6%). On multivariable analysis, patients residing in high EQI areas were less likely to achieve TO (referent: low EQI; odds ratio [OR]: 0.94, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.89-0.99; p\\u2009=\\u20090.02). Of note, Black patients living in moderate-to-high EQI counties had a 31% decreased likelihood of reaching a TO compared with White patients in low EQI counties (OR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.55-0.87). CONCLUSION: Patients residing in high EQI counties and Black race were associated with a lower likelihood of TO following resection of CRC among Medicare patients. Environmental factors may be important contributors to health care disparities and affect postoperative outcomes following CRC resection.\",\n"," '\"Time\" for obesity-related cancer: The role of the circadian rhythm in cancer pathogenesis and treatment.The circadian rhythm is regulated by an intrinsic time-tracking system, composed both of a central and a peripheral clock, which influences the cycles of activities and sleep of an individual over 24\\xa0h. At the molecular level, the circadian rhythm begins when two basic helix-loop-helix/Per-ARNT-SIM (bHLH-PAS) proteins, BMAL-1 and CLOCK, interact with each other to produce BMAL-1/CLOCK heterodimers in the cytoplasm. The BMAL-1/CLOCK target genes encode for the repressor components of the clock, cryptochrome (Cry1 and Cry2) and the Period proteins (Per1, Per2 and Per3). It has been recently demonstrated that the disruption of circadian rhythm is associated with an increased risk of developing obesity and obesity-related diseases. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the disruption of the circadian rhythm plays a key role in tumorigenesis. Further, an association between the circadian rhythm disruptions and an increased incidence and progression of several types of cancer (e.g., breast, prostate, colorectal and thyroid cancer) has been found. As the perturbation of circadian rhythm has adverse metabolic consequences (e.g., obesity) and at the same time tumor promoter functions, this manuscript has the aim to report how the aberrant circadian rhythms affect the development and prognosis of different types of obesity-related cancers (breast, prostate, colon rectal and thyroid cancer) focusing on both human studies and on molecular aspects.',\n"," 'The role of exercise in obesity-related cancers: Current evidence and biological mechanisms.Cancer ranks among the five leading causes of death in almost all countries and has important repercussions for individual and public health, the healthcare system, and society in general. Obesity increases the incidence of many types of cancer, but growing evidence suggests that physical activity may decrease risk for developing a variety of obesity-related cancer types, and, in some cases, may improve cancer prognosis and mortality rates. This review summarizes recent evidence on the effect of physical activity on obesity-related cancer prevention and survival. For some cancers, including breast, colorectal, and endometrial cancer, there is strong evidence for a preventative effect of exercise, but for many others, including gallbladder and kidney cancer, and multiple myeloma, evidence is inconsistent or largely lacking. Though many potential mechanisms have been proposed to explain the onco-protective effect of exercise, including improved insulin sensitivity, alterations in sex hormone availability, improved immune function and inflammation, myokine secretion, and modulation of intracellular signaling at the level of AMP kinase, the exact mechanism(s) of action within each cancer subtype remains poorly defined. Overall, a deeper understanding of how exercise can help against cancer and of the exercise parameters that can be altered to optimize exercise prescription is necessary and should be the subject of future investigation.',\n"," 'Suppression of small nucleolar RNA host gene 8 (SNHG8) inhibits the progression of colorectal cancer cells.Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common gastrointestinal malignancies around the world with high mortality. Accumulating evidences demonstrate that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play critical roles in CRC tumorigenesis by regulating different pathways of carcinogenesis. SNHG8 (small nucleolar RNA host gene 8), a lncRNA, is highly expressed in several cancers and acts as an oncogene that promotes cancer progression. However, the oncogenic role of SNHG8 in CRC carcinogenesis and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we explored the role of SNHG8 in CRC cell lines by performing a series of functional experiments. Similar to the data reported in the Encyclopedia of RNA Interactome, our RT-qPCR results showed that SNHG8 expression was significantly upregulated in CRC cell lines (DLD-1, HT-29, HCT-116, and SW480) compared to the normal colon cell line (CCD-112CoN). We performed dicer-substrate siRNA transfection to knockdown the expression of SNHG8 in HCT-116 and SW480\\xa0cell lines which were expressing high levels of SNHG8. SNHG8 knockdown significantly reduced CRC cell growth and proliferation by inducing autophagy and apoptosis pathways through the AKT/AMPK/mTOR axis. We performed wound healing migration assay and demonstrated that SNHG8 knockdown significantly increased migration index in both cell lines, indicating reduced migration abilities of cells. Further investigation showed that SNHG8 knockdown suppresses epithelial to mesenchymal transition and reduces cellular migratory properties of CRC cells. Taken together, our study suggests that SNHG8 acts as an oncogene in CRC through the mTOR-dependent autophagy, apoptosis, and EMT pathways. Our study provides a better understanding the role of SNHG8 in CRC at molecular level and SNHG8 might be used as novel therapeutic target for CRC management.',\n"," 'Effect of Spirituality-Based Palliative Care on Pain, Nausea,\\xa0Vomiting, and the\\xa0Quality of Life in Women with Colon Cancer: A Clinical Trial in Southern Iran.This randomized controlled clinical trial aimed to examine the effect of spirituality-based palliative care on pain, nausea,\\xa0vomiting, and the\\xa0quality of life in 80 Iranian colon cancer inpatients from January to June 2020 in southern Iran. Patients were randomly assigned to an intervention group and a control group. The intervention group took part in four 120-min sessions while the control group received standard care. Pain, nausea,\\xa0vomiting, and quality of life were assessed before the intervention and one month after the intervention. Data were analyzed using paired t-test and independent t-test. Between-groups differences analysis showed a significant difference in the quality of life scores, pain score, as well as nausea and vomiting scores following the one-month intervention. In conclusion, this group spirituality-based palliative care intervention might be beneficial in improving quality of life and reducing symptoms.',\n"," 'Germline variation in RASAL2 may predict survival in patients with RAS-activated colorectal cancer.BACKGROUND: Therapeutic agents that specifically target patients with RAS mutant colorectal cancer (CRC) are needed. We sought potential drug targets by relating genome-wide association study and survival data in patients with advanced CRC profiled for mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway mutations. METHODS: In total, 694 patients from the clinical trials COIN and COIN-B had MAPK-activated CRCs (assigned as KRAS, NRAS, or BRAF mutant). Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), gene, and gene-set analyses were performed to identify determinants of survival. For rs12028023 in RAS protein activator-like 2 (RASAL2), we studied its effect by MAPK pathway activation status (by comparing to 760 patients without MAPK-activated CRCs), MAPK gene mutation status, surface area of the primary tumor (as a marker of proliferation), and expression on RASAL2. RESULTS: In MAGMA genome-wide analyses, RASAL2 was the most significant gene associated with survival (p\\xa0=\\xa02.0\\xa0×\\u200910(-5) ). Patients carrying the minor (A) allele in the lead SNP, rs12028023 in intron 1 of RASAL2, had a median increase in survival of 167\\u2009days as compared with patients carrying the major allele. rs12028023 was predictive for survival by MAPK-activation status (p(Z-test) \\xa0=\\u20092.1\\xa0×\\u200910(-3) ). Furthermore, rs12028023 improved survival in patients with RAS mutant (hazard ratio [HR]\\xa0=\\xa00.62, 95% confidence intervals [CI]\\xa0=\\xa00.5-0.8, p\\xa0=\\u20093.4\\xa0×\\u200910(-5) ) but not BRAF mutant (p\\xa0=\\u20090.87) CRCs. The rs12028023 A-allele was associated with reduced surface area of the primary tumor (Beta\\xa0=\\xa0-0.037, standard error [SE]\\xa0=\\xa00.017, p\\xa0=\\u20093.2\\xa0×\\u200910(-2) ) and reduced RASAL2 expression in cultured fibroblasts (p\\xa0=\\u20091.6\\xa0×\\u200910(-11) ). CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate a prognostic role for RASAL2 in patients with MAPK-activated CRCs, with potential as a therapeutic target.',\n"," 'Outcomes of a Colorectal Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Protocol Modified for a Diverse and Urban Community.INTRODUCTION: Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) colorectal programs have been shown to improve the length of stay (LOS) without increasing hospital resource utilization at academic centers worldwide. A multidisciplinary ERAS protocol that includes preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative management guidelines was recently implemented at our urban, racially diverse, and academically affiliated community hospital. A delivery option was provided to reduce barriers to care. Given our unique patient population, the objective of our study was to determine if improvements in outcomes were reproducible in our hospital. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients undergoing elective colectomy at New York-Presbyterian Queens Hospital between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2020. Patient outcomes were compared between surgeries performed under standard practice (all colectomies prior to April 2017) and those performed after the implementation of the ERAS protocol. Demographic and perioperative data were abstracted from a prospectively derived database used to submit data to the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program. Additional data were obtained from chart review. RESULTS: Six hundred five elective colectomies were performed by 12 surgeons (range 1-228 cases) during the study period. Of these, 22 were performed open (41% followed ERAS), 467 were performed laparoscopically (57% followed ERAS), and 116 were performed robotically (74% followed ERAS). The average patient age was 64\\xa0y. Of which, 55% were male; 34% were Asian, 27% were non-Hispanic Caucasian, 27% were Hispanic, and 11% were Black or African American (all P-values > 0.05 for ERAS versus non-ERAS). Average duration of procedure was longer in the ERAS group (262\\xa0min versus 243\\xa0min, P\\xa0=\\xa00.04), although when stratified by procedure type, this relationship held true only for laparoscopic procedures. Hospital LOS was significantly shorter in the ERAS group (4.3 versus 5.4\\xa0d, P\\xa0<\\xa00.001) and this relationship held true for procedures performed both laparoscopically (4.2 versus 5.3\\xa0d, P\\xa0=\\xa00.01) and robotically (4.1 versus 5.1\\xa0d, P\\xa0=\\xa00.04). Of the ERAS group, patients who opted for delivery of ERAS components (n\\xa0=\\xa0205) had the shortest LOS when compared to patients who picked up components (n\\xa0=\\xa091) or opted out of ERAS (n\\xa0=\\xa0309) (4.1 versus 4.4 versus 5.2\\xa0d, P\\xa0=\\xa00.003). No significant differences were found for 30-d mortality, 30-d readmission, wound infection, or other postoperative complications (all P-values > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of an ERAS protocol in an urban, diverse, academically affiliated community hospital is associated with reductions in LOS for colectomies performed both laparoscopically and robotically. Facilitating ERAS compliance with a delivery option was also associated with improvements in hospital LOS. Preoperative nutrition supplementation was not associated with outcomes. No differences in mortality, readmission rates, or rates of postoperative complications were found.',\n"," \"Association of inflammatory bowel disease in first-degree relatives with risk of colorectal cancer: A nationwide case-control study in Sweden.This study aims to assess the association between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) history in first-degree relatives (FDRs) and colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. We conducted a nationwide case-control study in Sweden among 69\\u2009659 CRC cases and 343\\u2009032 non-CRC controls matched on age, sex, birth year and residence county. Through linkage of multi-generation register and the nationwide ESPRESSO (Epidemiology Strengthened by histoPathology Reports in Sweden) cohort, we ascertained IBD diagnoses among parents, full siblings and offspring of the index individuals. Odds ratios (ORs) of CRC associated with IBD family history were calculated using conditional logistic regression. 2.2% of both CRC cases (1566/69659) and controls (7676/343027) had ≥1 FDR with IBD history. After adjusting for family history of CRC, we observed no increased risk of CRC in FDRs of IBD patients (OR, 0.96; 95%CI, 0.91-1.02). The null association was consistent according to IBD subtype (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis), number of FDRs with IBD (1 or\\u2009≥\\u20092), age at first IBD diagnosis in FDRs (<18, 18-39, 40-59 or ≥60\\u2009years), maximum location/extent of IBD or FDR relation (parent, sibling or offspring). The null association remained for early-onset CRC (diagnosed at age <50\\u2009years). In conclusion, IBD history in FDRs was not associated with an increased risk of CRC. Our findings suggest that extra screening for CRC may not be needed in the offspring, siblings or parents of IBD patients, and strengthen the theory that it is the actual inflammation or atypia of the colon in IBD patients that confers the increased CRC risk.\",\n"," 'LncRNA PROX1 antisense RNA 1 promotes PD-L1-mediated proliferation, metastasis, and immune escape in colorectal cancer by interacting with miR-520d.It was recently found that lncRNA PROX1 antisense RNA 1 (PROX1-AS1) manifested oncogenicity in a variety of malignancies. This work intended to investigate the molecular mechanisms of PROX1-AS1 in colorectal cancer (CRC) development and immune evasion. In this study, both PROX1-AS1 and PD-L1 expressions were lifted in CRC tissues and cells. PROX1-AS1 interference restrained CRC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, as well as CD8 + T-lymphocyte apoptosis, but increased the cytotoxicity and percentage of CD8 + T lymphocytes. The inhibitory effects of PROX1-AS1 inhibition on CRC progression and immune escape were positively related to PD-L1 suppression. PROX1-AS1 absorbed miR-520d to upregulate PD-L1 expression. PROX1-AS1 facilitated CRC progression and immune escape by targeting miR-520d. Furthermore, PROX1-AS1 deletion impaired CRC tumor growth in vivo . To sum up, this study affirmed that PROX1-AS1 could absorb miR-520d to upregulate PD-L1 in CRC, thereby promoting tumor progression and immune escape.',\n"," \"Statewide Examination of Access to Cancer Surgery During the COVID-19 Pandemic.INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic caused interruptions in the delivery of medical care across a wide range of conditions including cancer. Trends in surgical treatment for cancer during the pandemic have not been well described. We sought to characterize associations between the pandemic and access to surgical treatment for breast, colorectal, and lung cancer in Illinois. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study evaluating inpatient admissions at Illinois hospitals providing surgical care for lung cancer (n\\xa0=\\xa01913 cases, n\\xa0=\\xa064 hospitals), breast cancer (n\\xa0=\\xa0910 cases, n\\xa0=\\xa0108 hospitals), and colorectal cancer (n\\xa0=\\xa05339 cases, n\\xa0=\\xa0144 hospitals). Using discharge data from the Illinois Health and Hospital Association's Comparative Health Care and Hospital Data Reporting Services database, average monthly surgical case volumes were compared from 2019 to 2020. We also compared rates of cancer surgery for each cancer type, by patient characteristics, and hospital type across the three time periods using Pearson chi-squared and ANOVA testing as appropriate. Three discrete time periods were considered: prepandemic (7-12/2019), primary pandemic (4-6/2020), and pandemic recovery (7-12/2020). Hospital characteristics evaluated included hospital type (academic, community, safety net), COVID-19 burden, and baseline cancer surgery volume. RESULTS: There were 2096 fewer operations performed for breast, colorectal, and lung cancer in 2020 than 2019 in Illinois, with the greatest reductions in cancer surgery volume occurring at the onset of the pandemic in April (colorectal, -48.3%; lung, -13.1%) and May (breast, -45.2%) of 2020. During the pandemic, breast (-14.6%) and colorectal (-13.8%) cancer surgery experienced reductions in volume whereas lung cancer operations were more common (+26.4%) compared to 2019. There were no significant differences noted in gender, race, ethnicity, or insurance status among patients receiving oncologic surgery during the primary pandemic or pandemic recovery periods. Academic hospitals, hospitals with larger numbers of COVID-19 admissions, and those with greater baseline cancer surgery volumes were associated with the greatest reduction in cancer surgery during the primary pandemic period (all cancer types, P\\xa0<\\xa00.01). During the recovery period, hospitals with greater baseline breast and lung cancer surgery volumes remained at reduced surgery volumes compared to their counterparts (P\\xa0<\\xa00.01). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with significant reductions in breast and colorectal cancer operations in Illinois, while lung cancer operations remained relatively consistent. Overall, there was a net reduction in cancer surgery that was not made up during the recovery period. Academic hospitals, those caring for more COVID-19 patients, and those with greater baseline surgery volumes were most vulnerable to reduced surgery rates during peaks of the pandemic and to delays in addressing the backlog of cases.\",\n"," 'Comment on: Clinical and molecular features of pediatric cancer patients with Lynch syndrome.nan',\n"," 'Prediagnostic serum glyceraldehyde-derived advanced glycation end products and mortality among colorectal cancer patients.Glyceraldehyde-derived advanced glycation end products (glycer-AGEs) could contribute to colorectal cancer development and progression due to their pro-oxidative and pro-inflammatory properties. However, the association of glycer-AGEs with mortality after colorectal cancer diagnosis has not been previously investigated. Circulating glycer-AGEs were measured by competitive ELISA. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations of circulating glycer-AGEs concentrations with CRC-specific and all-cause mortality among 1034 colorectal cancer (CRC) cases identified within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study between 1993 and 2013. During a mean of 48\\u2009months of follow-up, 529 participants died (409 from CRC). Glycer-AGEs were statistically significantly positively associated with CRC-specific (HR(Q5 vs Q1) \\xa0=\\u20091.53, 95% CI: 1.04-2.25, P(trend) =\\u2009.002) and all-cause (HR(Q5 vs Q1) \\xa0=\\u20091.62, 95% CI: 1.16-2.26, P(trend) <\\u2009.001) mortality among individuals with CRC. There was suggestion of a stronger association between glycer-AGEs and CRC-specific mortality among patients with distal colon cancer (per SD increment: HR(proximal colon) \\xa0=\\u20091.02, 95% CI: 0.74-1.42; HR(distal colon) \\xa0=\\u20091.51, 95% CI: 1.20-1.91; P(effect modification) =\\u2009.02). The highest HR was observed among CRC cases in the highest body mass index (BMI) and glycer-AGEs category relative to lowest BMI and glycer-AGEs category for both CRC-specific (HR\\xa0=\\xa01.78, 95% CI: 1.02-3.01) and all-cause mortality (HR\\xa0=\\xa02.15, 95% CI: 1.33-3.47), although no statistically significant effect modification was observed.

We are attempting to determine the clinical relevance of the mechanisms controlling the microRNA (miR-215 and miR-146a) expression and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)/interleukin-6 (IL-6) in a cross-link axis between obesity and colorectal cancer (CRC). Study participants were divided into four groups: healthy controls; obese without colorectal cancer; non-obese colorectal cancer; and obese with colorectal cancer. Obese and CRC patients had markedly higher expression of IL-6 and TGF-β, as well as tumor biomarkers, such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen 19.9 (CA19.9), and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels. The relative expression of microRNAs (miR-215 and miR-146a) was significantly lower in obese patients with colorectal cancer. BMI and the microRNAs(miR-215 and miR-146a) showed a substantial negative correlation. TGF-β was favorably linked with IL-6, cholesterol, triglyceride levels, and BMI. High levels of TGF-β and IL-6 in the blood indicate how intensely inflammation develops in obesity, which could increase the risk of colorectal cancer.',\n"," 'Comments on \"Epidemiology of overall and early-onset serrated polyps versus conventional adenomas in a colonoscopy screening cohort\".nan',\n"," 'Copper-cysteamine nanoparticle-mediated microwave dynamic therapy improves cancer treatment with induction of ferroptosis.Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) holds a great promise for cancer patients, however, due to the hypoxic characteristics of most solid tumors and the limited penetration depth of light in tissues, the extensive clinical application of PDT is limited. Herein, we report microwave induced copper-cysteamine (Cu-Cy) nanoparticles-based PDT as a promising cancer treatment to overcome cancer resistance in combination with ferroptosis. The treatment efficiency of Cu-Cy-mediated microwave dynamic therapy (MWDT) tested on HCT15 colorectal cancer (CRC) cells via cell titer-blue cell viability assay and live/dead assay reveal that Cu-Cy upon MW irradiation can effectively destroy HCT15 CRC cells with average IC-50 values of 20\\xa0μg/mL. The cytotoxicity of Cu-Cy to tumor cells after MW stimulation can be alleviated by ferroptosis inhibitor. Furthermore, Cu-Cy mediated MWDT could deplete glutathione peroxide 4 (GPX4) and enhance lipid peroxides (LPO) and malondialdehyde (MDA). Our findings demonstrate that MW-activated Cu-Cy killed CRC cells by inducing ferroptosis. The superior in vivo antitumor efficacy of the Cu-Cy was corroborated by a HCT15 tumor-bearing mice model. Immunohistochemical experiments showed that the GPX4 expression level in Cu-Cy\\xa0+\\xa0MW group was significantly lower than that in other groups.

Furthermore, THTF restored abnormal fecal metabolite levels. It showed a strong correlation among gut microbiota, metabolites, and tumor weight. Finally, THTF promoted Bifidobacterium pseudolongum growth in vitro, whose cell-free supernatant further inhibited HCT116 cell proliferation and clonogenicity. Together, THTF delays CRC tumor growth by maintaining microbiota homeostasis, restoring fecal metabolites, and protecting intestinal function.',\n"," '\"It\\'s cancer screening after all\". Barriers to cervical and colorectal cancer screening and attitudes to promotion of self-sampling kits upon attendance for breast cancer screening.OBJECTIVES: To explore barriers to cervical and colorectal cancer screening and attitudes to promotion of self-sampling kits upon attendance for breast cancer screening. METHODS: Interview study with women who had not responded to one or more invitations to cervical or colorectal cancer screening. A semi-structured interview guide was used and interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Concepts from Temporal Motivation Theory were used to structure and analyse the data. RESULTS: Twenty-two women were interviewed. Screening was highly valued but the women perceived screening for cervical cancer and colorectal cancer as more troublesome to participate in, compared with participation in breast cancer screening. The lack of a pre-booked appointment or a suggested deadline attenuated the perceived value of cervical and colorectal cancer screening and this further increased procrastination. Promotion of self-sampling kits for cervical and colorectal cancer screening upon attendance for breast cancer screening was considered a feasible way to increase salience of both types of screening. CONCLUSION: A high number of micro steps and absence of a deadline in cervical and colorectal cancer screening diverted attention away from screening participation in cervical and colorectal cancer screening. The main facilitator could be reduction of micro actions, proposing a suggested deadline, and promotion of self-sampling kits when attending breast cancer screening to increase salience and a renewed attention to all three screening programmes.',\n"," 'Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on colorectal cancer screening in New York City.BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the delivery of cancer screening. The resulting decrease in outpatient visits and cancellations of non-urgent procedures have negatively affected colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. We aimed to determine the effect of the pandemic on CRC screening at a safety-net hospital and a private health system based in New York City. METHODS: We identified individuals eligible for CRC screening aged 50 to 75 years presenting for outpatient care at a safety-net public hospital and private health system in April through September of 2019 and 2020. The primary outcome was the proportion of screening-eligible patients seen in primary care who underwent CRC screening. RESULTS: The safety-net hospital had 516 (6.1% of screening-eligible individuals) and 269 (4.3%) screening tests completed in 2019 and 2020, respectively (p < 0.01). Fecal immunochemical tests (FIT) accounted for 69.6% of screening in 2019 and 88.1% in 2020. Colonoscopy accounted for 20.3% of screening in 2019 and 11.9% in 2020. The private health system had 39 (0.7%) and 21 (0.6%) screening tests completed in 2019 and 2020, respectively (p\\u2009=\\u20090.48). FIT accounted for 61.9% of screening in 2019 and 57.1% in 2020. Colonoscopy accounted for 38.1% of screening in 2019 and 42.9% in 2020. CONCLUSION: Absolute numbers of screening tests decreased for both institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic. We observed a decrease in screening uptake and increase in proportional FIT use in the safety-net hospital but no change in the private health system.',\n"," 'Targeting the (pro)renin receptor in cancers: from signaling to pathophysiological effects.Cancer is a major public health problem, currently affecting hundreds of millions of people worldwide, and its clinical results are unpredictable, partly due to the lack of reliable biomarkers of cancer progression. Recently, it has been reported that (pro)renin receptor (PRR), as a new biomarker, plays an important role in different types of cancer, such as colorectal cancer, breast cancer, glioma, aldosterone-producing adenoma, endometrial cancer, urothelial cancer, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. In order to comprehensively and systematically understand the relationship and role of PRR with various cancers, this review will summarize the current research on targeting PRR in cancer from signaling to pathophysiological effects,\\xa0including the correlation between PRR/sPRR expression level and different cancers, potential mechanisms regulated by PRR in the progress of cancers, and PRR in cancer treatment. PRR can be a novel and promising biomarker and potential therapeutic target for diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis in cancer, which is worthy of extensive development and application in clinics.',\n"," 'The Supplement of Magnesium Element to Inhibit Colorectal Tumor Cells.Magnesium ions are essential elements to the human body, with a daily intake of about 350\\xa0mg for an adult. Recently, a meta-analysis reported that magnesium ion intake is related to a reduced risk of colorectal tumors. In addition, implantation of biodegradable magnesium pins after colorectal tumor resection could potentially inhibit the residual tumor cells. These impressive results implied that magnesium ions possess inhibitory properties against colorectal carcinoma. However, this hypothesis has yet to be confirmed by experimental results. In this work, different concentrations of magnesium ions were modulated to investigate their inhibitory effects on cell viability through cell cycle arrest, subsequently inducing apoptosis by activating the caspase-3 pathway. The animal experiments revealed that magnesium injection restricted tumor growth after 3\\xa0weeks of treatment compared to the control group. According to the immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy results, the remarkable effect may be attributed to promoting the apoptotic rate of tumor cells. The evidence highlights the potential for the clinical use of magnesium implants to inhibit the growth of residual cells after colorectal tumor surgery.',\n"," 'Metabolic pathway-based molecular subtyping of colon cancer reveals clinical immunotherapy potential and prognosis.PURPOSE: Colon cancer presents challenges to clinical diagnosis and management due to its high heterogeneity. For more efficient and convenient diagnosis and treatment of colon cancer, we are committed to characterizing the molecular features of colon cancer by pioneering a classification system based on metabolic pathways. METHODS: Based on the 113 metabolic pathways and genes collected in the previous stage, we scored and filtered the metabolic pathways of each sample in the training set by ssGSEA, and obtained 16 metabolic pathways related to colon cancer recurrence. In consistent clustering of training set samples with recurrence-related metabolic pathway scores, we identified two robust molecular subtypes of colon cancer (MC1 and MC2). Furthermore, we performed multi-angle analysis on the survival differences of subtypes, metabolic characteristics, clinical characteristics, functional enrichment, immune infiltration, differences with other subtypes, stemness indices, TIDE prediction, and drug sensitivity, and finally constructed colon cancer prognostic model. RESULTS: The results showed that the MC1 subtype had a poor prognosis based on higher immune activity and immune checkpoint gene expression. The MC2 subtype is associated with high metabolic activity and low expression of immune checkpoint genes and a better prognosis. The MC2 subtype was more responsive to PD-L1 immunotherapy than the MC1 subclass. However, we did not observe significant differences in tumor mutational burden between the two. CONCLUSION: Two molecular subtypes of colon cancer based on metabolic pathways have distinct immune signatures. Constructing prognostic models based on subtype differential genes provides valuable reference for personalized therapy targeting unique tumor metabolic signatures.',\n"," 'FOSL2 promotes intertumoral infiltration of T cells and increases pathological complete response rates in locally advanced rectal cancer patients.The outcome of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) remains highly unpredictable for individuals with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). We set out to characterize effective biomarkers that promote a pathological complete response (pCR). We quantified the abundances of 6483 high-confidence proteins in pre-nCRT biopsies of 58 LARC patients from two hospitals with pressure cycling technology (PCT)-assisted pulse data-independent acquisition (PulseDIA) mass spectrometry. Compared with non-pCR patients, pCR patients achieved long-term disease-free survival (DFS) and had higher tumor immune infiltration, especially CD8(+) T cell infiltration, before nCRT. FOSL2 was selected as the candidate biomarker for predicting pCR and was found to be significantly upregulated in pCR patients, which was verified in another 54 pre-nCRT biopsies of LARC patients by immunohistochemistry. FOSL2 expression was able to predict pCR by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) with high efficiency (Area under curve (AUC)\\xa0=\\xa00.939, specificity\\xa0=\\xa01.000, sensitivity\\xa0=\\xa00.850), and high FOSL2 expression was associated with long-term DFS (p\\xa0=\\xa00.044). When treated with simulated nCRT, FOSL2 sufficiency resulted in more significant inhibition of cell proliferation, and more significant promotion of cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis. Moreover, CXCL10 secretion with abnormal cytosolic dsDNA accumulation was found in FOSL2-wildtype (FOSL2-WT) tumor cells over nCRT, which might elevate CD8(+) T-cell infiltration and CD8(+) T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity to promote nCRT-induced antitumor immunity. Our study revealed proteomic profiles in LARC patients before nCRT and highlighted immune activation in the tumors of patients who achieved pCR. We identified FOSL2 as a promising biomarker to predict pCR and promote long-term DFS by contributing to CD8(+) T-cell infiltration.',\n"," 'Slow skeletal muscle troponin T acts as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for hepatocellular carcinoma.Slow skeletal muscle troponin T (TNNT1) as a poor prognostic indicator is upregulated in colon and breast cancers. However, the role of TNNT1 in the disease prognosis and biological functions of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still unclear. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), immunoblot, and immunohistochemical analyses were applied to evaluate the TNNT1 expression of human HCC. The impact of TNNT1 levels on disease progression and survival outcome was studied using TCGA analysis. Moreover, the bioinformatics analysis and HCC cell culture were used to investigate the biological functions of TNNT1. Besides, the immunoblot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to detect the extracellular TNNT1 of HCC cells and circulating TNNT1 of HCC patients, respectively. The effect of TNNT1 neutralization on oncogenic behaviors and signaling was further validated in the cultured hepatoma cells. In this study, tumoral and blood TNNT1 was upregulated in HCC patients based on the analyses using bioinformatics, fresh tissues, paraffin sections, and serum. From the multiple bioinformatics tools, the TNNT1 overexpression was associated with advanced stage, high grade, metastasis, vascular invasion, recurrence, and poor survival outcome in HCC patients. By the cell culture and TCGA analyses, TNNT1 expression and release were positively correlated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) processes in HCC tissues and cells. Moreover, TNNT1 neutralization suppressed oncogenic behaviors and EMT in hepatoma cells. In conclusion, TNNT1 may serve as a non-invasive biomarker and drug target for HCC management. This research finding may provide a new insight for HCC diagnosis and treatment.',\n"," \"Carboxypeptidase A6 suppresses the proliferation and invasion of colorectal cancer cells and is negatively regulated by miR-96-3p.BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignant tumor, and this study aims to explore the role and the regulatory mechanism of carboxypeptidase A6 (CPA6) in CRC cells. METHODS: Specific shRNA targeting CPA6 mRNA was transfected into NCM460 and HT29\\xa0cells to down-regulate CPA expression, and expression plasmid was transfected into HCT116\\xa0cells to exogenously overexpress CPA6. The dual luciferase assay was used to detect the direct binding of miR-96-3p to CPA6 3'UTR. Phosphorylation and activation of Akt were detected using Western blot. Cells were treated with miR-96-3p mimics, Akt inhibitor (MK-2206) or agonist (SC79) for rescue experiments. The cell functions were evaluated using CCK-8, clone formation, transwell, and Western blot assays. Xenograft tumor assay was also used to analyze the effect of altered CPA6 expression on tumor growth. RESULTS: Knockdown of CPA6 promoted the proliferation, clone formation, migration, and invasion of NCM460 and HT29\\xa0cells in vitro, and the tumor growth of nude mouse xenograft tumor in vivo. Moreover, over-expression of CPA6 significantly inhibited the malignant proliferation and invasion of HCT116\\xa0cells in vitro, and the tumor growth of xenograft tumor in vivo. Furthermore, miR-96-3p could directly regulate CPA6 expression by targeting its 3'UTR, and miR-96-3p mimics rescued the inhibitory effects of CPA6 overexpression on the malignant proliferation and invasion of CRC cells. Finally, CPA6 knockdown enhanced Akt/mTOR phosphorylation and activation, while CPA6 overexpression inhibited Akt/mTOR activation. The regulatory effect of CPA6 on Akt/mTOR signaling was naturally regulated by miR-96-3p. Akt inhibitor or agonist rescued the effects of CPA6 knockdown or overexpression on proliferation and EMT of colon cancer cells. CONCLUSION: CPA6 has a significant tumor suppressive effect on CRC by inhibiting the activation of Akt/mTOR signaling, and miR-96-3p negatively regulates the expression of CPA6.\",\n"," 'Development of new TAK-285 derivatives as potent EGFR/HER2 inhibitors possessing antiproliferative effects against 22RV1 and PC3 prostate carcinoma cell lines.Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein tyrosine kinases co-expressed in various cancers such as ovarian, breast, colon, and prostate subtypes. Herein, new TAK-285 derivatives (9a-h) were synthesised, characterised, and biologically evaluated as dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitors. Compound 9f exhibited IC(50) values of 2.3\\u2009nM over EGFR and 234\\u2009nM over HER2, which is 38-fold of staurosporine and 10-fold of TAK-285 over EGFR. Compound 9f also showed high selectivity profile when tested over a small kinase panel. Compounds 9a-h showed IC(50) values in the range of 1.0-7.3\\u2009nM and 0.8-2.8\\u2009nM against PC3 and 22RV1 prostate carcinoma cell lines, respectively. Cell cycle analysis, apoptotic induction, molecular docking, dynamics, and MM-GBSA studies confirmed the plausible mechanism(s) of compound 9f as a potent EGFR/HER2 dual inhibitor with an effective antiproliferative action against prostate carcinoma.',\n"," 'Novel Glu-based pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine analogues: design, synthesis and biological evaluation as DHFR and TS dual inhibitors.A novel series of multifunctional pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine-based glutamate analogs (6a-l and 7a,b) have been designed and synthesized as antifolate anticancer agents. Among the tested compounds, 6i exhibited the most potent anti-proliferative activity towards NSCLC, CNS, Ovarian, Prostate, Colon, Melanoma, Breast, and Renal cancers with good to weak cytostatic activity and non-lethal actions. 6i demonstrated higher selectivity for cancer than normal cells. 6i could significantly increase the accumulation of S-phase cells during the cell cycle distribution of cancer cells with high potency in the induction of apoptosis. The results unveiled that 6i probably acts through dual inhibition of DHFR and TS enzymes (IC(50) = 2.41 and 8.88\\u2009µM, correspondingly). Docking studies of 6i displayed that N1-p-bromophenyl and C3-Methyl groups participate in substantial hydrophobic interactions. The drug-likeness features inferred that 6i met the acceptance criteria of Pfizer. Taking together, 6i could be a promising prototype for further optimization as an effective anticancer drug.',\n"," 'Association between body mass index, metabolic syndrome and common urologic conditions: a cross-sectional study using a large multi-institutional database from the United States.INTRODUCTION: The study aims to determine whether body mass index (BMI), metabolic syndrome (MS) or its individual components (primary hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemias) are risk factors for common urological diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study with data collected on February 28, 2022 from the TriNetX Research Network. Patients were divided in cohorts according to their BMI, presence of MS (BMI > 30\\u2009kg/m(2), type 2 diabetes mellitus, primary hypertension and disorders of lipoprotein metabolism) and its individual components and its association with common urological conditions was determined. For each analysis, odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Statistical significance was assessed at p\\u2009<\\u2009.05. RESULTS: BMI\\u2009>\\u200930\\u2009kg/m(2) was associated with increased risk of lithiasis, kidney cancer, overactive bladder, male hypogonadism, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and erectile dysfunction (p\\u2009<\\u2009.05). On the contrary, BMI was inversely associated with ureteral, bladder and prostate cancer (p\\u2009<\\u2009.05). In all urological diseases, MS was the strongest risk factor, with prostate cancer (OR = 2.53) showing the weakest and male hypogonadism the strongest (OR\\u2009=\\u200913.00) associations. CONCLUSIONS: MS and its individual components were significant risk factors for common urological conditions. Hence holistic approaches with lifestyle modification might prevent common urological disease.Key messagesOverall, metabolic syndrome is the strongest risk factor for all the analysed urological diseases.Abnormally high body mass index can be a risk or protective factor depending on the threshold and urological disease that are being evaluated.Metabolic syndrome and increased BMI should be considered important factors associated to the prevalence of common urological diseases.',\n"," 'A Modified Net Reclassification Improvement Statistic.The continuous net reclassification improvement (NRI) statistic is a popular model change measure that was developed to assess the incremental value of new factors in a risk prediction model. Two prominent statistical issues identified in the literature call the utility of this measure into question: (1) it is not a proper scoring function and (2) it has a high false positive rate when testing whether new factors contribute to the risk model. For binary response regression models, these subjects are interrogated and a modification of the continuous NRI, guided by the likelihood-based score residual, is proposed to address these issues. Within a nested model framework, the modified NRI may be viewed as a distance measure between two risk models. An application of the modified NRI is illustrated using prostate cancer data.',\n"," 'Application of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in men over 75 years: an analysis of comparative outcomes.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to summarize the current evidence regarding the feasibility of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) in men aged over 75\\u2009years. METHOD: A comprehensive search of four electronic databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure, PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library) was performed to identify eligible comparative studies as of April 2022. Parameters, including perioperative results and oncological and functional outcomes, were evaluated. RESULTS: Seven articles with 7575 patients undergoing RARP were included in this study. Patients with prostate cancer were grouped by age ≥ 75\\u2009years versus < 75\\u2009years. Our results demonstrated that compared with the older group, the younger group had better potency (p\\u2009<\\u2009.00001). However, there were no significant differences in operation time (p\\u2009=\\u2009.29), estimated blood loss (p\\u2009=\\u2009.13), length of hospital stay (p\\u2009=\\u2009.48), complications (p\\u2009=\\u2009.22), continence (p\\u2009=\\u2009.21), positive surgical margin (p\\u2009=\\u2009.28), and biochemical recurrence (p\\u2009=\\u2009.74) between the groups. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that the perioperative, oncological, and functional outcomes in men aged over 75\\u2009years undergoing RARP were not significantly different from those of their younger counterparts. RARP is feasible in men aged over 75\\u2009years.',\n"," 'Integrative exploration of the mutual gene signatures and immune microenvironment between benign prostate hyperplasia and castration-resistant prostate cancer.BACKGROUND: Benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer (CaP) are among the most frequently occurring prostatic diseases. When CaP progressed to castration-resistant CaP (CRPC), the prognosis is poor. Although CaP/CRPC and BPH frequently coexist in prostate, the inter-relational mechanism between them is largely unknown. METHODS: Single-cell RNA sequencing, bulk-RNA sequencing, and microarray data of BPH, CaP in the Gene Expression Omnibus database were obtained and comprehensively analyzed. Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and lasso regression analysis were performed to explore the potential biomarkers. RESULTS: With WGCNA, five modules in BPH, two in CaP, and three in CRPC were identified as significant modules. Pathway enrichment analysis found that the epigenetics and chromosomal-related signaling were dominantly clustered in the CaP group but not in BPH and CRPC. Lasso regression analysis was used to analyze further the mutual genes between the BPH module and the CRPC module. As a result, DDA1, ERG28, OGFOD1, and OXA1L were significantly correlated with the transcriptomic features in both BPH and CRPC. More importantly, the role of the four gene signatures was validated in two independent anti-PD-1 immunotherapy cohort. CONCLUSION: This study revealed the shared gene signatures and immune microenvironment between BPH and CRPC. The identified hub genes, including DDA1, ERG28, OGFOD1, and OXA1L, might be potential therapeutic targets for facilitating immunotherapy in prostate cancer.',\n"," 'Risk analysis of metformin use in prostate cancer: a national population-based study.INTRODUCTION: Various approaches are required to prevent and treat heterogeneity-based prostate cancer. Here, we analyzed the anticancer effects of metformin, which has a good toxicity profile and is inexpensive. METHOD: From January 2010 to December 2019, analysis was conducted retrospectively in a cohort from the National Health Insurance Service database. The wash-out period was set for cancer diagnosis in 2010 and 2011, and subjects (105,279) diagnosed with prostate cancer (ICD C61) from 2012 to 2014 were excluded The final subjects (105,216) were defined as the metformin administration group when they took metformin for 180\\u2009days or more from January 2012 to December 2019. The non-metformin group was defined as those who took less than 180\\u2009days from January 2012 to December 2019. The prevalence of prostate cancer according to metformin administration and the risk according to the cumulative duration of metformin were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 105,216 people were included in this study, with 59,844 in the metformin group and 45,372 in the metformin non-administration group. When calculating HRs (Hazard Rate) according to the cumulative period of metformin administration, metformin administration period length was inversely associated with prostate cancer risk (Q2\\u2009HR = 0.791 95% CI: 0.773-0.81, Q3\\u2009HR = 0.634 95% CI: 0.62-0.649, Q4\\u2009HR = 0.571 95% CI: 0.558-0.585). HRs tended to decrease with the cumulative duration of metformin administration. CONCLUSION: This study confirmed that prostate cancer risk decreased with increasing duration of metformin administration. Metformin should be considered as a new strategy in the treatment and prevention of prostate cancer characterized by heterogeneity.',\n"," \"Surgical and medical co-management optimizes surgical outcomes in older patients with chronic diseases undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.INTRODUCTION: While robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RRP) is a standard mode for localized prostate cancer (PC), the risk of complications in older patients with chronic diseases and complex medical conditions can be a deterrent to surgery. Surgical and medical co-management (SMC) is a new strategy to improve patients' healthcare outcomes in surgical settings. METHODS: We reviewed the clinical data of older patients with chronic diseases who were cared for with SMC undergoing RRP in our hospital in the past 3\\u2009years and compared them with the clinical data from the general urology ward. Preoperative conditions and related indicators of recovery, and incidence of postoperative complications with the Clavien Grade System were compared between these two groups. RESULTS: The indicators of recovery were significantly better, and the incidence rates of complications were significantly reduced in the SMC group at grades I-IV (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05), as compared to the general urology ward group. CONCLUSIONS: The provision of care by SMC for older patients focused on early identification, comorbidity management, preoperative optimization, and collaborative management would significantly improve surgical outcomes. The SMC strategy is worthy of further clinical promotion in RRP treatment in older men with chronic diseases and complex medical conditions.\",\n"," \"CircDHRS3 inhibits prostate cancer cell proliferation and metastasis through the circDHRS3/miR-421/MEIS2 axis.Prostate cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer among men worldwide. The importance of circular RNA (circRNA) in prostate cancer and its connection to malignancy has been steadily recognized. circRNA expression was obtained by circRNA sequencing of prostate cancer. circRNA and its function were further analysed. The results were verified by qRT-PCR, RIP assay, FISH, RNA pulldown, WB, CCK-8, colony formation assay and wound-healing assay. BALB/c Nude mice were used for xenograft hosts. Low expression of circDHRS3 was assessed in prostate cancer. Overexpression of circDHRS3 inhibited prostate cancer growth and migration in vitro. Additionally, miR-421 was shown to be the downstream target of circDHRS3, as shown by fluorescence in situ hybridization and dual-luciferase experiments. The rescue assay results for the PC3 and Du145 cell lines demonstrated that circDHRS3 inhibits prostate cancer cell lines' ability to proliferate and metastasize by modulating MEIS2 expression through the circDHRS3/miR-421/MEIS2 axis. In vivo investigations confirmed that the overexpression of circDHRS3 could inhibit both the lung and bone metastasis of prostate cancer cells. circDHRS3 has the potential to become a biomarker and a targeted therapeutic site for prostate cancer, particularly in the malignant stage. Our study indicates that circDHRS3 inhibits prostate cancer cell proliferation and metastasis through the circDHRS3/miR-421/MEIS2 axis.\",\n"," 'Simultaneous administration of EZH2 and BET inhibitors inhibits proliferation and clonogenic ability of metastatic prostate cancer cells.Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a common treatment for recurrent prostate cancer (PC). However, after a certain period of responsiveness, ADT resistance occurs virtually in all patients and the disease progresses to lethal metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Aberrant expression and function of the epigenetic modifiers EZH2 and BET over activates c-myc, an oncogenic transcription factor critically contributing to mCRPC. In the present work, we tested, for the first time, the combination of an EZH2 inhibitor with a BET inhibitor in metastatic PC cells. The combination outperformed single drugs in inhibiting cell viability, cell proliferation and clonogenic ability, and concomitantly reduced both c-myc and NF-kB expression. Although these promising results will warrant further in\\xa0vivo validation, they represent the first step to establishing the rationale that the proposed combination might be suitable for mCRPC treatment, by exploiting molecular targets different from androgen receptor.',\n"," 'Discovery of new pyridine-quinoline hybrids as competitive and non-competitive PIM-1 kinase inhibitors with apoptosis induction and caspase 3/7 activation capabilities.New quinoline-pyridine hybrids were designed and synthesised as PIM-1/2 kinase inhibitors. Compounds 5b, 5c, 6e, 13a, 13c, and 14a showed in-vitro low cytotoxicity against normal human lung fibroblast Wi-38 cell line and potent in-vitro anticancer activity against myeloid leukaemia (NFS-60), liver (HepG-2), prostate (PC-3), and colon (Caco-2) cancer cell lines. In addition, 6e, 13a, and 13c significantly induced apoptosis with percentage more than 66%. Moreover, 6e, 13a, and 13c significantly induced caspase 3/7 activation in HepG-2 cell line. Furthermore, 5c, 6e, and 14a showed potent in-vitro PIM-1 kinase inhibitory activity. While, 5b showed potent in-vitro PIM-2 kinase inhibitory activity. Kinetic studies using Lineweaver-Burk double-reciprocal plot indicated that 5b, 5c, 6e, and 14a behaved as competitive inhibitors while 13a behaved as both competitive and non-competitive inhibitor of PIM-1 kinase enzyme. Molecular docking studies indicated that, in-silico affinity came in coherence with the observed in-vitro inhibitory activities against PIM-1/2 kinases.',\n"," 'Quantitative longitudinal mapping of radiation-treated prostate cancer using MR fingerprinting with radial acquisition and subspace reconstruction.MR fingerprinting (MRF) enables fast multiparametric quantitative imaging with a single acquisition and has been shown to improve diagnosis of prostate cancer. However, most prostate MRF studies were performed with spiral acquisitions that are sensitive to B0 inhomogeneities and consequent blurring. In this work, a radial MRF acquisition with a novel subspace reconstruction technique was developed to enable fast T1/T2 mapping in the prostate in under 4 min. The subspace reconstruction exploits the extensive temporal correlations in the MRF dictionary to pre-compute a low dimensional space for the solution and thus reduce the number of radial spokes to accelerate the acquisition. Iterative reconstruction with the subspace model and additional regularization of the signal representation in the subspace is performed to minimize the number of spokes and maintain matching quality and SNR. Reconstruction accuracy was assessed using the ISMRM NIST phantom. In-vivo validation was performed on two healthy subjects and two prostate cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy. The longitudinal repeatability was quantified using the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) in one of the healthy subjects by repeated scans over 1 year. One prostate cancer patient was scanned at three time points, before initiating therapy and following brachytherapy and external beam radiation. Changes in the T1/T2 maps obtained with the proposed method were quantified. The prostate, peripheral and transitional zones, and visible dominant lesion were delineated for each study, and the statistics and distribution of the quantitative mapping values were analyzed. Significant image quality improvements compared with standard reconstruction methods were obtained with the proposed subspace reconstruction method. A notable decrease in the spread of the T1/T2 values without biasing the estimated mean values was observed with the subspace reconstruction and agreed with reported literature values. The subspace reconstruction enabled visualization of small differences in T1/T2 values in the tumor region within the peripheral zone. Longitudinal imaging of a volunteer subject yielded CCC of 0.89 for MRF T1, and 0.81 for MRF T2 in the prostate gland. Longitudinal imaging of the prostate patient confirmed the feasibility of capturing radiation treatment related changes. This work is a proof-of-concept for a high resolution and fast quantitative mapping using golden-angle radial MRF combined with a subspace reconstruction technique for longitudinal treatment response assessment in subjects undergoing radiation treatment.',\n"," 'Dual probe difference specimen imaging for prostate cancer margin assessment.SIGNIFICANCE: Positive margin status due to incomplete removal of tumor tissue during radical prostatectomy for high-risk localized prostate cancer requires reoperation or adjuvant therapy, which increases morbidity and mortality. Adverse effects of prostate cancer treatments commonly include erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, and bowel dysfunction, making successful initial curative prostatectomy imperative. AIM: Current intraoperative tumor margin assessment is largely limited to frozen section analysis, which is a lengthy, labor-intensive process that is obtrusive to the clinical workflow within the operating room (OR). Therefore, a rapid method for prostate cancer margin assessment in the OR could improve outcomes for patients. APPROACH: Dual probe difference specimen imaging (DDSI), which uses paired antibody-based probes that are labeled with spectrally distinct fluorophores, was shown herein for prostate cancer margin assessment. The paired antibody-based probes consisted of a targeted probe to prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and an untargeted probe, which were used as a cocktail to stain resected murine tissue specimens including prostate tumor, adipose, muscle, and normal prostate. Ratiometric images (i.e., DDSI) of the difference between targeted and untargeted probe uptake were calculated and evaluated for accuracy using receiver operator characteristic curve analysis with area under the curve values used to evaluate the utility of the DDSI method to detect PSMA positive prostate cancer. RESULTS: Targeted and untargeted probe uptake was similar between the high and low PSMA expressing tumor due to nonspecific probe uptake after topical administration. The ratiometric DDSI approach showed substantial contrast difference between the PSMA positive tumors and their respective normal tissues (prostate, adipose, muscle). Furthermore, DDSI showed substantial contrast difference between the high PSMA expressing tumors and the minimally PSMA expressing tumors due to the ratiometric correction for the nonspecific uptake patterns in resected tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Previous work has shown that ratiometic imaging has strong predictive value for breast cancer margin status using topical administration. Translation of the ratiometric DDSI methodology herein from breast to prostate cancers demonstrates it as a robust, ratiometric technique that provides a molecularly specific imaging modality for intraoperative margin detection. Using the validated DDSI protocol on resected prostate cancers permitted rapid and accurate assessment of PSMA status as a surrogate for prostate cancer margin status. Future studies will further evaluate the utility of this technology to quantitatively characterize prostate margin status using PSMA as a biomarker.',\n"," 'Versatile FeMoOv nanozyme bipolar electrode electrochemiluminescence biosensing and imaging platform for detection of H(2)O(2) and PSA.In this work, a unique FeMoOv nanozyme-bipolar electrode (NM-BPE) electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensing and imaging platform was proposed for the first time to realize sensitive detection of target hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and prostate specific antigen (PSA). Considering the advantage that the cathode and anode poles of the bipolar electrode (BPE) can be modified respectively, this work was carried out using anode equipped with ECL reagent bipyridine ruthenium (Ru(bpy)(3)(2+)), and cathode equipped with the Fe-doped molybdenum oxide/Au nanoparticles (FeMoOv/AuNPs) with excellent peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT)-like activity. Because FeMoOv/AuNPs show efficient enzyme catalysis eﬀect and can greatly promote the decomposition of H(2)O(2), thus the electron transfer rate in the NM-BPE system would be much accelerated to enhance the ECL signal of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+). Based on this principle, this work not only realized sensitive detection of H(2)O(2), but also ingeniously designed an sandwich immunosensor using FeMoOv/AuNPs as recognition probe to mediate the ECL response on the anode, achieving highly sensitive detection of PSA. Furthermore, a unique mobile phone ECL imaging system was developed for assay of PSA at different concentrations, which opened a new portable imaging sensing device for bioassays. This work was the first time to combine nanozymes with bipolar electrodes for ECL analysis and imaging, which not only broadened the applications of nanozymes, but also pioneered the new joint ECL research technique of bipolar electrode and ECL imaging in bioassays, showing great application prospect for multiple detection of proteins, nucleic acids and cancer cells.',\n"," 'Successful Salvage Brachytherapy after Infusion of Gold AuroShell Nanoshells for Localized Prostate Cancer in a Human Patient.nan',\n"," \"Comparison of quantitative parameters and radiomic features as inputs into machine learning models to predict the Gleason score of prostate cancer lesions.INTRODUCTION: The classification of prostate cancer (PCa) lesions using Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) suffers from poor inter-reader agreement. This study compared quantitative parameters or radiomic features from multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) or positron emission tomography (PET), as inputs into machine learning (ML) to predict the Gleason scores (GS) of detected lesions for improved PCa lesion classification. METHODS: 20 biopsy-confirmed PCa subjects underwent imaging before radical prostatectomy. A pathologist assigned GS from tumour tissue. Two radiologists and one nuclear medicine physician delineated the lesions on the mpMR and PET images, yielding 45 lesion inputs. Seven quantitative parameters were extracted from the lesions, namely T2-weighted (T2w) image intensity, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), transfer constant (K(TRANS)), efflux rate constant (K(ep)), and extracellular volume ratio (V(e)) from mpMR images, and SUV(mean) and SUV(max) from PET images. Eight radiomic features were selected out of 109 radiomic features from T2w, ADC and PET images. Quantitative parameters or radiomic features, with risk factors of age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), PSA density and volume, of 45 different lesion inputs were input in different combinations into four ML models - Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest-Neighbour (kNN), Ensembles model (EM). RESULTS: SUV(max) yielded the highest accuracy in discriminating detected lesions. Among the 4 ML models, kNN yielded the highest accuracies of 0.929 using either quantitative parameters or radiomic features with risk factors as input. CONCLUSIONS: ML models' performance is dependent on the input combinations and risk factors further improve ML classification accuracy.\",\n"," 'Dynamics of CXCR4 positive circulating tumor cells in prostate cancer patients during radiotherapy.Ablative radiotherapy is a highly efficient treatment modality for patients with metastatic prostate cancer (PCa). However, a subset of patients does not respond. Currently, this subgroup with bad prognosis cannot be identified before disease progression. We hypothesize that markers indicative of radioresistance, stemness and/or bone tropism may have a prognostic potential to identify patients profiting from metastases-directed radiotherapy. Therefore, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) were analyzed in patients with metastatic PCa (n\\xa0=\\xa024) during radiotherapy with CellSearch, multicolor flow cytometry and imaging cytometry. Analysis of copy-number alteration indicates a polyclonal CTC population that changes after radiotherapy. CTCs were found in 8 out of 24 patients (33.3%) and were associated with a shorter time to biochemical progression after radiotherapy. Whereas the total CTC count dropped after radiotherapy, a chemokine receptor CXCR4-expressing subpopulation representing 28.6% of the total CTC population remained stable up to 3 months. At once, we observed higher chemokine CCL2 plasma concentrations and proinflammatory monocytes. Additional functional analyses demonstrated key roles of CXCR4 and CCL2 for cellular radiosensitivity, tumorigenicity and stem-like potential in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, a high CXCR4 and CCL2 expression was found in bone metastasis biopsies of PCa patients. In summary, panCK(+) CXCR4(+) CTCs may have a prognostic potential in patients with metastatic PCa treated with metastasis-directed radiotherapy.',\n"," 'PIM1 phosphorylates ABI2 to enhance actin dynamics and promote tumor invasion.Distinguishing key factors that drive the switch from indolent to invasive disease will make a significant impact on guiding the treatment of prostate cancer (PCa) patients. Here, we identify a novel signaling pathway linking hypoxia and PIM1 kinase to the actin cytoskeleton and cell motility. An unbiased proteomic screen identified Abl-interactor 2 (ABI2), an integral member of the wave regulatory complex (WRC), as a PIM1 substrate. Phosphorylation of ABI2 at Ser183 by PIM1 increased ABI2 protein levels and enhanced WRC formation, resulting in increased protrusive activity and cell motility. Cell protrusion induced by hypoxia and/or PIM1 was dependent on ABI2. In vivo smooth muscle invasion assays showed that overexpression of PIM1 significantly increased the depth of tumor cell invasion, and treatment with PIM inhibitors significantly reduced intramuscular PCa invasion. This research uncovers a HIF-1-independent signaling axis that is critical for hypoxia-induced invasion and establishes a novel role for PIM1 as a key regulator of the actin cytoskeleton.',\n"," 'The ethanol extract of Cyperus exaltatus var. iwasakii exhibits cell cycle dysregulation, ERK1/2/p38 MAPK/AKT phosphorylation, and reduced MMP-9-mediated metastatic capacity in prostate cancer models in vitro and in vivo.BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death worldwide in men. The development of novel and highly efficient therapeutic strategies is strongly recommended to treat prostate cancer. Cyperaceae are an ecologically and economically important family of plants with several pharmacological effects. However, the biological efficacy of Cyperus exaltatus var. iwasakii (CE) is unknown. PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the antitumor effect of the ethanol extract of CE against prostate cancer. METHODS: In vitro antitumor efficacy of CE was explored by the MTT assay, cell counting assay, FACS analysis, immunoblot, wound-healing migration, invasion assay, zymographic assay, and EMSA in prostate cancer cells, DU145 and LNCaP. For in vivo experiments, xenograft mice were injected with LNCaP cells. Histology (H&E and Ki-67) and biochemical enzyme assay were then performed. The toxicity test was evaluated by an acute toxicity assay. The phytochemical constituents of CE were identified by spectrometric and chromatographic analyses. RESULTS: CE exerted a significant antiproliferative effect against prostate cancer cells. CE-induced antiproliferative cells were associated with cell cycle arrest at G(0)/G(1) (cyclin D1/CDK4, cyclin E/CDK2, p21(Waf1)) in DU145 cells, but G(2)/M (ATR, CHK1, Cdc2, Cdc25c, p21(Waf1), and p53) in LNCaP cells. CE stimulated the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and AKT in DU145 cells, but only p38 MAPK phosphorylation was increased in LNCaP cells. CE treatment suppressed migration and invasion in the two types of prostate cancer cells by inhibiting MMP-9 activity through the regulation of transcription factors, such as AP-1 and NF-κB. In vivo experiments showed a reduction in tumor weight and size following oral CE administration. Histochemistry confirmed that CE inhibited tumor growth in the mouse LNCaP xenograft model. The administration of CE had no adverse effects on body weight, behavioral patterns, blood biochemistry, and histopathology findings of vital organs in mice. Finally, a total of 13 phytochemical constituents were identified and quantified in CE. The most abundant secondary metabolites in CE were astragalin, tricin, and p-coumaric acid. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated the antitumor efficacy of CE against prostate cancer. These findings suggest that CE might be a potential candidate for prostate cancer prevention or treatment.',\n"," 'Rational design, synthesis and biological evaluation of benzo[d]isoxazole derivatives as potent BET bivalent inhibitors for potential treatment of prostate cancer.Multivalency is an attractive strategy for effective binding to target protein. Bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family features two tandem bromodomains (BD1, BD2), which are considered to be potential new targets for prostate cancer. Herein, we report the rational design, optimization, and evaluation of a class of novel BET bivalent inhibitors based on our monovalent BET inhibitor 7 (Y06037). The representative bivalent inhibitor 17b effectively inhibited the cell growth of LNCaP, exhibiting 32 folds more potency than monovalent inhibitor 7. Besides, 17b induced 95.1\\xa0% PSA regression in LNCaP cell at 2\\xa0μM. Docking study was further carried out to reveal the potential binding mode of 17b with two BET bromodomains. Our study demonstrates that 17b (Y13021) is a promising BET bivalent inhibitor for the treatment of prostate cancer.',\n"," 'A case of metastatic adenoid cystic (basal cell) carcinoma of the prostate: Systemic therapy for a rare disease.BACKGROUND: Metastatic adenoid cystic (basal cell) carcinoma of the prostate is an exceedingly rare disease entity. As a result, no current consensus exists for optimal systemic therapy. METHODS: We present a patient with metastatic adenoid cystic (basal cell) carcinoma of the prostate who subsequently received systemic treatment, including chemotherapy and immunotherapy. We comprehensively reviewed all published data on therapy outcomes in advanced disease. RESULTS: Our patient benefited from combination chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel), with objective radiographic response and reduction in cancer-related pain. However, chemotherapy was stopped due to cumulative neurotoxicity, and subsequent immunotherapy with atezolizumab did not produce any response. Our literature review revealed inconsistent outcomes with various treatments but showed most promise with chemotherapy. Targeted therapy and immunotherapy seem to benefit specific cases, and androgen deprivation therapy had minimal evidence of benefit. CONCLUSION: Based on the findings of our case report and literature review, we suggest platinum-based chemotherapy doublets as first-line treatment for metastatic cases of adenoid cystic (basal cell) carcinoma of the prostate, reserving targeted therapy or immunotherapy for select cases based upon molecular profiles.',\n"," 'Male Reproduction and Aging.Recent publications of well-conducted population studies have informed us that the syndromic prevalence of age-related low testosterone, also known as late-onset hypogonadism, is quite low. Several well-conducted trials in middle-aged and older men with age-related decline in testosterone levels have revealed that efficacy of testosterone therapy is modest with improvement in sexual function, mood, volumetric bone density, and anemia. Although select older men might benefit from testosterone therapy, its effect on prostate cancer risk and major adverse cardiovascular events remains unclear. The results of the ongoing TRAVERSE trial will likely provide important insights into these risks.',\n"," 'Significance of extraprostatic extension by Grade Groups 1-3 prostatic carcinoma on needle biopsy.BACKGROUND: It is rare for extraprostatic extension (EPE) on biopsy to be seen with Grade Groups (GG) 1-3 (Gleason scores 3\\u2009+\\u20093\\u2009=\\u20096; 3\\u2009+\\u20094\\u2009=\\u20097; 4\\u2009+\\u20093\\u2009=\\u20097) prostatic adenocarcinoma, and there is no data whether this finding should be a contraindication for performing radical prostatectomy (RP). METHODS: Thirty eight cases with GG 1-3 prostatic adenocarcinoma as the highest grade in the case with EPE on biopsy were identified from our consultation files. Highly unfavorable findings at RP were those that if they could have been predicted preoperatively, might have factored into the decision of whether to proceed with surgery. For these purposes, highly unfavorable pathology at RP was defined as either the presence of seminal vesicle invasion or lymph node metastases or GG5 (Gleason score 9-10). RESULTS: Among 37 patients with clinical follow-up data, 18 (49%) received radiation and/or hormonal therapy (RT/HT), 13 patients (35%) either underwent (n\\u2009=\\u200911) or are planning (n\\u2009=\\u20092) RP, and 6 patients (16%) received either ablation therapy or active surveillance. Based on the 11 RP pathology reports, 8 were GG2, one GG3 with tertiary pattern 5, and two GG3. Ten cases were reported to have EPE and six cases had positive margins. Only one had highly unfavorable pathology with pT3bN1 disease. The only difference between the RP and the RT/HT groups in their pretreatment parameters was the mean age of the RP patients was 61 compared with 69 for the RT/HT men (p\\u2009=\\u20090.02); the lack of many cases with highly unfavorable pathology at RP cannot be attributable to a selection bias of men with lower volume cancer on biopsy or lower serum prostate-specific antigen levels choosing RP over RT/HT. CONCLUSIONS: Despite EPE on biopsy, most men do not have highly unfavorable pathology at RP, and this treatment should remain an option in this setting.',\n"," 'Erratum to \"Fractionated stereotactic body radiotherapy for up to five prostate cancer oligometastases: Interim outcomes of a prospective clinical trial\".nan',\n"," \"Adverse metabolic consequences of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) on Asian patients with prostate cancer: Primary results from the real-life experience of ADT in Asia (READT) study.BACKGROUND: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) use in prostate cancer (PCa) has seen a rising trend. We investigated the relationship between ADT and adverse changes in metabolic parameters in an Asian population. METHODS: This is an international prospective multicenter single-arm cohort yielded from the real-life experience of ADT in Asia\\xa0(READT) registry. Consecutive ADT-naïve patients diagnosed of PCa and started on ADT were prospectively recruited from 2016 and analyzed. Baseline patient characteristics, PCa disease status, and metabolic parameters were documented. Patients were followed up at 6-month interval for up to 5 years. Metabolic parameters including body weight, lipid profiles, and glycemic profiles were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: 589 patients were eligible for analysis. ADT was associated with adverse glycemic profiles, being notable at 6 months upon ADT initiation and persisted beyond 1 year. Comparing to baseline, fasting glucose level and hemoglobin A1c level increased by 4.8% (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001) and 2.7% (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001), respectively. Triglycerides level was also elevated by 16.1% at 6th month and by 20.6% at 12th month compared to baseline (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Mean body weight was 1.09\\u2009kg above baseline at 18th month (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). CONCLUSION: ADT was associated with adverse metabolic parameters in terms of glycemic profiles, lipid profiles, and body weight in the Asian population. These changes developed early in the treatment and can persist beyond the first year. Regular monitoring of the biochemical profiles during treatment is paramount in safeguarding the patients' metabolic health.\",\n"," 'Efficacy of zoledronic acid for the elimination of disseminated tumor cells in a clinically relevant, spontaneously metastatic prostate cancer xenograft model.Bone metastases develop in >90\\xa0% of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (PCa) through complex interactions between the bone microenvironment and tumor cells. Previous androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), which is known to cause bone loss, as well as anti-resorptive agents such as zoledronic acid (ZA), used to prevent skeletal complications, may influence these interactions and thereby the growth of disseminated tumor cells (DTC) in the bone marrow (BM). Here, a spontaneously metastatic xenograft tumor model of human PCa was further optimized to mimic the common clinical situation of ADT (castration) combined with primary tumor resection in vivo. The effects of these interventions, alone or in combination with ZA treatment, on tumor cell dissemination to the BM and other distant sites were analyzed. Metastatic burden was quantified by human-specific Alu-qPCR, bioluminescence imaging (BLI), and immunohistochemistry. Further, bone remodeling was assessed by static histomorphometry and serum parameters. Initial comparative analysis between NSG and SCID mice showed that spontaneous systemic dissemination of subcutaneous PC-3 xenograft tumors was considerably enhanced in NSG mice. Primary tumor resection and thereby prolonged observational periods resulted in a higher overall metastatic cell load at necropsy and tumor growth alone caused significant bone loss, which was further augmented by surgical castration. In addition, castrated mice showed a strong trend towards higher bone metastasis loads. Weekly treatment of mice with ZA completely prevented castration- and tumor-induced bone loss but had no effect on bone metastasis burden. Conversely, the total lung metastasis load as determined by BLI was significantly decreased upon ZA treatment. These findings provide a basis for future research on the role of ZA not only in preventing skeletal complications but also in reducing metastasis to other organs.',\n"," \"Prognostic factors of overall and prostate-specific antigen-progression-free survival in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with (177) Lu-PSMA-617. A single-center prospective observational study.BACKGROUND: Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is characterized by heterogeneity among patients as well as therapy responses due to diverse genetic, epigenetic differences, and resistance mechanisms. At this stage of the disease, therapy modalities should be individualized in light of the patients' clinical state, symptoms, and genetic characteristics. In this prospective study, we aimed to evaluate the outcome of patients with mCRPC treated with (177) Lutetium labeled PSMA-617 therapy (PSMA-RLT), as well as baseline and therapy-related parameters associated with survival. METHODS: This prospective study included 52 patients who received two to six cycles of PSMA-RLT. Primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-progression-free survival (PFS). (18) F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and (68) Ga-PSMA (PSMA) Positron Emission Tomography/Computer Tomography (PET/CT) scans were performed for a comprehensive assessment of tumor burden and heterogeneity. Biochemical, imaging, clinical, and therapy-related parameters were analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier, log-rank, and Cox regression analyses to predict OS and PFS. RESULTS: Median OS and PSA-PFS were 17.7 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 15.2-20.2) and 6.6 months (95% CI: 4.5-8.8), respectively. Primary resistance to PSMA-RLT (hazard ratio [HR]: 12.57, 95% CI: 2.4-65.2, p: 0.003), <30% PSA response rate after first cycle of PSMA-RLT (HR: 1.016, 95% CI: 1.006-1.03, p: 0.003), FDG\\u2009>\\u2009PSMA disease (HR: 4.9, 95% CI: 1.19-20.62, p: 0.03), PSA doubling time (PSA DT) of ≤2.4 months (HR: 15.7, 95% CI: 3.7-66.4, p: <0.0001), and low hemoglobin levels (HR: 0.59, 95%\\xa0CI: 0.41-0.83, p: 0.003) were correlated with poor OS in the multivariate analysis. Bone scintigraphy\\u2009> PSMA\\xa0disease (HR: 5.6; 95%\\xa0CI: 1.8-17, p: 0.002) and high C-reactive protein (HR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1-1.7, p: 0.001) were significant predictive biomarkers for PFS in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: PSA response rate and pattern to PSMA-RLT are the most important predictors of survival in patients receiving PSMA-RLT. Being a strong predictive biomarker, combined FDG and PSMA PET can be helpful for the decision of PSMA-RLT eligibility.\",\n"," 'Salvage stereotactic reirradiation for intraprostatic cancer recurrence: A large retrospective study.INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. Thirty to forty-seven percent of patients treated with exclusive radiotherapy for prostate cancer will experience intraprostate recurrence. The use of radiotherapy in stereotactic conditions allows millimetric accuracy in irradiation to the target zone that minimizes the dose to organs at risk. In this study, we evaluated the clinical outcome of prostatic reirradiation with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in patients with intraprostatic recurrence initially treated by radiotherapy. METHOD: This single-center retrospective study included 41 patients diagnosed with exclusive local recurrence of prostate cancer after radiotherapy and treatedby stereotactic Cyberknife irradiation. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and the safety of stereotactic reirradiation for patients with intraprostatic recurrence initially treated with radiotherapy. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 35 months. The 2-year biochemical relapse-free survival was 72.89%, the 2-year local recurrence free survival was 93.59%, the 2-year local regional recurrence-free survival was 85.24%, and the 2-year metastasis-free survival was to 91.49%. The analysis of toxicities showed a good tolerance of stereotactic irradiation. Urinary and gastro-intestinal adverse events was mostly of grades 1-2 (CTCAEv4). Grade 3 toxicity occurred in one to two patients. CONCLUSION: Stereotactic reirradiation appears effective and well-tolerated for local recurrence of prostate cancer and might allow to delay the introduction of hormonal therapy and its side effects.',\n"," 'Patient-reported functional outcomes and oncological control after primary focal cryotherapy for clinically significant prostate cancer: A Phase II mandatory biopsy-monitored study.INTRODUCTION: We report herein the impact of focal therapy (FT) on multi-domain functional outcomes in a Phase II prospective clinical trial (NCT04138914) in focal cryotherapy for clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). METHODS: The primary outcome was the detection of a ≥5 point deterioration in any of the four main expanded prostate index composite (EPIC) functional domains. Pretreatment multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and transperineal targeted and systematic saturation biopsy were used to select patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA)≤20\\u2009ng/mL, Gleason grade group (GG) ≤4, mpMRI lesion volume\\u2009≤\\u20093\\u2009mL (for a single lesion) or ≤1.5\\u2009mL (where two lesions were present). Focal cryotherapy was performed with a minimum 5\\u2009mm margin around each target lesion. EPIC scores were obtained at baseline and posttreatment at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Mandatory repeat mpMRI and prostate biopsy were performed at 12 months to determine the infield and outfield recurrence. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were recruited. The mean age was 68 years, with PSA of 7.3\\u2009ng/mL and PSA density of 0.19\\u2009ng/mL(2) . No Clavien-Dindo ≥3 complications occurred. Transient worsening of EPIC urinary (mean diff 16.0, p\\u2009<\\u20090.001, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.8-23.6) and sexual function scores (mean diff 11.0, p:0.005, 95% CI: 4.0-17.7) were observed at 1-month posttreatment, with recovery by Month 3. A subgroup who had ablation extending to the neurovascular bundle had a trend to delayed recovery of sexual function to Month 6. At 12-month repeat mpMRI and biopsy, 22 patients (78.6%) had no detectable csPCa. Of the six patients (21.4%) who had csPCa recurrences, four were GG2, one GG3, and one GG4. Four patients underwent repeat FT, one underwent radical prostatectomy, while the remaining one patient with low-volume GG2 cancer opted for active surveillance. CONCLUSION: FT using cryotherapy was associated with a transient deterioration of urinary and sexual function with resolution at 3 months posttreatment and with reasonable early efficacy in well-selected csPCa patients.',\n"," 'The role of multiparametric magnetic resonance in active surveillance of a low-risk prostate cancer cohort from clinical practice.INTRODUCTION: Active surveillance (AS) is considered a suitable management practice for those patients with low-risk prostate cancer (PCa). At present, however, the role of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) in AS protocols has not yet been clearly established. OUTCOMES: To determine the role of mpMRI and its ability to detect significant prostate cancer (SigPCa) in PCa patients enrolled in AS protocols. MATERIALS AND METHODS: There were 229 patients enrolled in an AS protocol between 2011 and 2020 at Reina Sofía University Hospital. MRI interpretation was based on PIRADS v.1 or v.2/2.1 classification. Demographics, clinical, and analytical data were collected and analyzed. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated for mpMRI in different scenarios. We defined SigPCa and reclassification/progression as a Gleason score (GS)\\u2009≥\\u20093\\u2009+\\u20094, a clinical stage ≥T2b, or an increase in PCa volume. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests were used to estimate progression-free survival time. RESULTS: Median age was 69.02 (±7.73) at diagnosis, with a 0.15 (±0.08) PSA density (PSAD). Eighty-six patients were reclassified after confirmatory biopsy, with a suspicious mpMRI an indication for a clear reclassification and risk-predictor factor in disease progression (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). During follow-up, 46 patients were changed from AS to active treatment mainly due to disease progression. Ninety patients underwent ≥2mpMRI during follow-up, with a median follow-up of 29 (15-49) months. Thirty-four patients had a baseline suspicious mpMRI (at diagnostic or confirmatory biopsy): 14 patients with a PIRADS 3 and 20 patients with ≥PIRADS 4. From 14 patients with a PIRADS 3 baseline mpMRI, 29% progressed radiologically, with a 50% progression rate versus 10% (1/10 patients) for those with similar or decreased mpMRI risk. Of the 56 patients with a non-suspicious baseline mpMRI (PIRADS\\u2009<\\u20092), 14 patients (25%) had an increased degree of radiological suspicion, with a detection rate of SigPCa of 29%. The mpMRI NPV during follow-up was 0.91. CONCLUSION: A suspicious mpMRI increases the reclassification and disease progression risk during follow-up and plays an important role in monitoring biopsies. In addition, a high NPV at mpMRI follow-up can help to decrease the need to monitor biopsies during AS.',\n"," 'Obesity and main urologic cancers: Current systematic evidence, novel biological mechanisms, perspectives and challenges.Urologic cancers (UC) account for 13.1% of all new cancer cases and 7.9% of all cancer-related deaths. A growing body of evidence has indicated a potential causal link between obesity and UC. The aim of the present review is to appraise in a critical and integrative manner evidence from meta-analyses and mechanistic studies on the role of obesity in four prevalent UC (kidney-KC, prostate-PC, urinary bladder-UBC, and testicular cancer-TC). Special emphasis is given on Mendelian Randomization Studies (MRS) corroborating a genetic causal association between obesity and UC, as well as on the role of classical and novel adipocytokines. Furthermore, the molecular pathways that link obesity to the development and progression of these cancers are reviewed. Available evidence indicates that obesity confers increased risk for KC, UBC, and advanced PC (20-82%, 10-19%, and 6-14%, respectively), whereas for TC adult height (5-cm increase) may increase the risk by 13%. Obese females tend to be more susceptible to UBC and KC than obese males. MRS have shown that a higher genetic-predicted BMI may be causally linked to KC and UBC but not PC and TC. Biological mechanisms that are involved in the association between excess body weight and UC include the Insulin-like Growth Factor axis, altered availability of sex hormones, chronic inflammation and oxidative stress, abnormal secretion of adipocytokines, ectopic fat deposition, dysbiosis of the gastrointestinal and urinary tract microbiomes and circadian rhythm dysregulation. Anti-hyperglycemic and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, statins, and adipokine receptor agonists/antagonists show potential as adjuvant cancer therapies. Identifying obesity as a modifiable risk factor for UC may have significant public health implications, allowing clinicians to tailor individualized prevention strategies for patients with excess body weight.',\n"," '\"Time\" for obesity-related cancer: The role of the circadian rhythm in cancer pathogenesis and treatment.The circadian rhythm is regulated by an intrinsic time-tracking system, composed both of a central and a peripheral clock, which influences the cycles of activities and sleep of an individual over 24\\xa0h. At the molecular level, the circadian rhythm begins when two basic helix-loop-helix/Per-ARNT-SIM (bHLH-PAS) proteins, BMAL-1 and CLOCK, interact with each other to produce BMAL-1/CLOCK heterodimers in the cytoplasm. The BMAL-1/CLOCK target genes encode for the repressor components of the clock, cryptochrome (Cry1 and Cry2) and the Period proteins (Per1, Per2 and Per3). It has been recently demonstrated that the disruption of circadian rhythm is associated with an increased risk of developing obesity and obesity-related diseases. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the disruption of the circadian rhythm plays a key role in tumorigenesis. Further, an association between the circadian rhythm disruptions and an increased incidence and progression of several types of cancer (e.g., breast, prostate, colorectal and thyroid cancer) has been found. As the perturbation of circadian rhythm has adverse metabolic consequences (e.g., obesity) and at the same time tumor promoter functions, this manuscript has the aim to report how the aberrant circadian rhythms affect the development and prognosis of different types of obesity-related cancers (breast, prostate, colon rectal and thyroid cancer) focusing on both human studies and on molecular aspects.',\n"," \"A prospective study of the relationship between CRPC patient's quality of life after enzalutamide and serum testosterone levels measured via LC-MS/MS.BACKGROUND: Enzalutamide (ENZ) is used in the treatment of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). The quality of life (QoL) of CRPC patients during ENZ treatment is very important, but predictive markers of QoL have not been identified. We investigated the relationship between the serum testosterone (T) level before ENZ treatment and QoL changes in CRPC patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective study was conducted between 2014 and 2018 at Gunma University Hospital and related facilities. We analyzed 95 patients in whom QoL could be evaluated using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) questionnaire at baseline, and after 4 and 12 weeks of ENZ treatment. Serum T levels were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). RESULTS: The study population of 95 patients had a median age of 72 years and median prostate-specific antigen level of 21.6\\u2009ng/mL. The median overall survival from the commencement of ENZ treatment was 26.8 months. The median serum T level before ENZ treatment was 50.0\\u2009pg/mL. The mean total FACT-P scores at baseline, and after 4 and 12 weeks of ENZ treatment, were 95.8, 91.7, and 90.1, respectively. Differences in FACT-P scores between the high T level (High-T) group and low T level (Low-T) group (distinguished based on median split of the T level) were examined. The mean FACT-P scores were significantly higher in the High-T than Low-T group after both 4 and 12 weeks of ENZ treatment (98.5 vs. 84.6 and 96.4 vs. 82.2, respectively, both p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The mean FACT-P score was significantly lower in the Low-T group after 12 weeks than before ENZ treatment (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). CONCLUSION: The serum T level before treatment may be useful for predicting QoL changes after ENZ treatment in CRPC patients.\",\n"," 'Postoperative functional and cancer control evaluation of conventional and Retzius-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: Comparison of selected cases by propensity score matching.AIM: Although many reports have shown that Retzius-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RS-RARP) is effective for postoperative urinary continence, the postoperative voiding status and sexual function associated with this technique have not yet been adequately compared with those associated with conventional RARP (C-RARP). In this study, the lower urinary tract function, erectile function, and cancer control after C-RARP and RS-RARP were compared chronologically. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We selected 50 cases of C-RARP and RS-RARP each by propensity score matching and evaluated them over time using various questionnaires. Urinary continence recovery rates and biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared between the two groups using the log-rank test. RESULTS: When urinary continence was defined as 0 pads per day, 0 pads per day\\u2009+\\u20091 security linear, or ≤1 pad per day, the postoperative improvement in urinary continence was better with RS-RARP over the course of up to 1 year for all definitions. The International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form total scores and the Overactive Bladder Symptom Scores were better in the postoperative RS-RARP group. There were no significant differences in the International Prostate Symptom Score total score, QOL score, and erectile hardness score between the two groups during the observation period. The BCR-free survival did not differ significantly between the two groups CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative urinary continence was better in the RS-RARP group than in the C-RARP group; however, the voiding function, erectile function, and cancer control did not differ significantly.',\n"," 'Age-related differences in cancer relative survival in the United States: A SEER-18 analysis.Cancer survival has improved since the 1990s, but to different extents across age groups, with a disadvantage for older adults. We aimed to quantify age-related differences in relative survival (RS-1-year and 1-year conditioning on surviving 1 year) for 10 common cancer types by stage at diagnosis. We used data from 18 United States Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results cancer registries and included cancers diagnosed in 2012 to 2016 followed until December 31, 2017. We estimated absolute differences in RS between the 50 to 64 age group and the 75 to 84 age group. The smallest differences were observed for prostate and breast cancers (1.8%-points [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.5-2.1] and 1.9%-points [95% CI: 1.5-2.3], respectively). The largest was for ovarian cancer (27%-points, 95% CI: 24-29). For other cancers, differences ranged between 7 (95% CI: 5-9, esophagus) and 18%-points (95% CI: 17-19, pancreas). Except for pancreatic cancer, cancer type and stage combinations with very high (>95%) or very low (<40%) 1-year RS tended to have smaller age-related differences in survival than those with mid-range prognoses. Age-related differences in 1-year survival conditioning on having survived 1-year were small for most cancer and stage combinations. The broad variation in survival differences by age across cancer types and stages, especially in the first year, age-related differences in survival are likely influenced by amenability to treatment. Future work to measure the extent of age-related differences that are avoidable, and identify how to narrow the survival gap, may have most benefit by prioritizing cancers with relatively large age-related differences in survival (eg, stomach, esophagus, liver and pancreas).',\n"," 'Prostate lesion segmentation based on a 3D end-to-end convolution neural network with deep multi-scale attention.Prostate cancer is one of the deadest cancers among human beings. To better diagnose the prostate cancer, prostate lesion segmentation becomes a very important work, but its progress is very slow due to the prostate lesions small in size, irregular in shape, and blurred in contour. Therefore, automatic prostate lesion segmentation from mp-MRI is a great significant work and a challenging task. However, the most existing multi-step segmentation methods based on voxel-level classification are time-consuming, may introduce errors in different steps and lead to error accumulation. To decrease the computation time, harness richer 3D spatial features, and fuse the multi-level contextual information of mp-MRI, we present an automatic segmentation method in which all steps are optimized conjointly as one step to form our end-to-end convolutional neural network. The proposed end-to-end network DMSA-V-Net consists of two parts: (1) a 3D V-Net is used as the backbone network, it is the first attempt in employing 3D convolutional neural network for CS prostate lesion segmentation, (2) a deep multi-scale attention mechanism is introduced into the 3D V-Net which can highly focus on the ROI while suppressing the redundant background. As a merit, the attention can adaptively re-align the context information between the feature maps at different scales and the saliency maps in high-levels. We performed experiments based on five cross-fold validation with data including 97 patients. The results show that the Dice and sensitivity are 0.7014 and 0.8652 respectively, which demonstrates that our segmentation approach is more significant and accurate compared to other methods.',\n"," 'Prostate cancer lesion detection, volume quantification and high-grade cancer differentiation using cancer risk maps derived from multiparametric MRI with histopathology as the reference standard.Multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) has proven itself a clinically useful tool to assess prostate cancer (PCa). Our objective was to generate PCa risk maps to quantify the volume and location of both all PCa and high grade (Gleason grade group ≥ 3) PCa. Such capabilities would aid physicians and patients in treatment decisions, targeting biopsy, and planning focal therapy. A cohort of men with biopsy proven prostate cancer and pre-prostatectomy mpMRI were studied. PCa and benign ROIs (1524) were identified on mpMRI and histopathology with histopathology serving as the reference standard. Logistic regression models were created to differentiate PCa from benign tissues. The MRI images were registered to ensure correct overlay. The cancer models were applied to each image voxel within prostates to create probability maps of cancer and of high-grade cancer. Use of an optimum probability threshold quantified PCa volume for all lesions >0.1\\xa0cc. Accuracies were calculated using area under the curve (AUC) for the receiver operating characteristic (ROC). The PCa models utilized apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), T2 weighted (T2W), dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE MRI) enhancement slope, and DCE MRI washout as the statistically significant MRI scans. Application of the PCa maps method provided total PCa volume and individual lesion volumes. The AUCs derived from lesion analysis were 0.91 for all PCa and 0.73 for high-grade PCa. At the optimum threshold, the PCa maps detected 135 / 150 (90%) histopathological lesions >0.1\\xa0cc. This study showed the feasibility of cancer risk maps, created from pre-prostatectomy, mpMR images validated with histopathology, to detect PCa lesions >0.1\\xa0cc. The method quantified the volume of cancer within the prostate. Method improvements were identified by determining root causes for over and underestimation of cancer volumes. The maps have the potential for improved non-invasive capability in quantitative detection, localization, volume estimation, and MRI characterization of PCa.',\n"," 'Diagnostic role of plasma ORM2 in differentiating prostate cancer from benign prostatic hyperplasia.PURPOSE: Markers are needed to increase the diagnostic accuracy of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in prostate cancer (PCa) screening. Mounting evidence has shown that plasma proteins can be hopeful biomarkers for cancer diagnosis. METHODS: Tandem mass tag (TMT)-based proteomics and parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) analysis were used to screen the differential proteins and further validated in other independent studies (n\\u2009=\\u2009539). Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC), decision curves and nomograms were applied to assess the diagnostic accuracy of biomarkers. RESULTS: Three candidate proteins (DBP, LCAT and ORM2) were preliminarily screened. Subsequent validation studies revealed significant upregulation of ORM2 in PCa patients across other independent cohorts. ORM2 yielded excellent discriminative power for PCa from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients (AUC\\u2009=\\u20090.861 and 0.814 in validation phases 2a and 2b, respectively). Importantly, the combination of ORM2 and PSA gave better predictive accuracy than PSA alone. We incorporated age, PSA and ORM2 into a nomogram, which yielded C-index of 0.883 in validation phase 2a. A similar C-index of 0.879 was obtained in external validation phase 2b. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our study suggests that ORM2 could be treated as a complementary biomarker for PSA in distinguishing PCa from BPH.',\n"," 'BDNF and its signaling in cancer.PURPOSE: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) belongs to the family of neurotrophic factors that can potentially\\xa0increase cancer cell growth, survival, proliferation, anoikis, and migration by tyrosine kinase receptors TrkB and the\\xa0p75NTR death receptor. The activation of BDNF/TrkB pathways leads to several downstream signaling pathways,\\xa0including PI3K/Akt, Jak/STAT, PLCγ, Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK, NF-kB, and transactivation of EGFR. The current review\\xa0aimed to provide an overview of the role of BDNF and its signaling in cancer. METHODS: We searched a major\\xa0medical database, PubMed, to identify eligible studies for a narrative synthesis. RESULTS: Pathological examinations\\xa0demonstrate BDNF overexpression in human cancer, notably involving the prostate, lung, breast, and underlying\\xa0tissues, associated with a higher death rate and poor prognosis. Therefore, measurement of BDNF, either for\\xa0identifying the disease or predicting response to therapy, can be helpful in cancer patients. Expression profiling\\xa0studies have recognized the role of microRNAs (miR) in modulating BDNF/TrkB pathways, such as miR-101, miR-107, miR-134, miR-147, miR-191, miR-200a/c, miR-204, miR-206, miR-210, miR-214, miR-382, miR-496, miR-497, miR-744, and miR-10a-5p, providing a potential biological mechanism by which targeted therapies may correlate\\xa0with decreased BDNF expression in cancers. Clinical studies investigating the use of agents targeting BDNF\\xa0receptors and related signaling pathways and interfering with the related oncogenic effect, including Entrectinib,\\xa0Larotrectinib, Cabozantinib, Repotrectinib, Lestaurtinib, and Selitrectinib, are in progress. CONCLUSION: The aberrant\\xa0signaling of BDNF is implicated in various cancers. Well-designed clinical trials are needed to clarify the BDNF role\\xa0in cancer progression and target it as a therapeutic method.',\n"," \"Whole-exome sequencing of Indian prostate cancer reveals a novel therapeutic target: POLQ.PURPOSE: Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer diagnosed worldwide and the third most common cancer among men in India. This study's objective was to characterise the mutational landscape of Indian prostate cancer using whole-exome sequencing to identify population-specific polymorphisms. METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing was performed of 58 treatment-naive primary prostate tumors of Indian origin. Multiple computational and statistical analyses were used to profile the known common mutations, other deleterious mutations, driver genes, prognostic biomarkers, and gene signatures unique to each clinical parameter. Cox analysis was performed to validate survival-associated genes. McNemar test identified genes significant to recurrence and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted to determine its accuracy. OncodriveCLUSTL algorithm was used to deduce driver genes. The druggable target identified was modeled with its known inhibitor using Autodock. RESULTS: TP53 was the most commonly mutated gene in our cohort. Three novel deleterious variants unique to the Indian prostate cancer subtype were identified: POLQ, FTHL17, and OR8G1. COX regression analysis identified ACSM5, a mitochondrial gene responsible for survival. CYLC1 gene, which encodes for sperm head cytoskeletal protein, was identified as an unfavorable prognostic biomarker indicative of recurrence. The novel POLQ mutant, also identified as a driver gene, was evaluated as the druggable target in this study. POLQ, a DNA repair enzyme implicated in various cancer types, is overexpressed and is associated with a poor prognosis. The mutant POLQ was subjected to structural analysis and modeled with its known inhibitor novobiocin resulting in decreased binding efficiency necessitating the development of a better drug. CONCLUSION: In this pilot study, the molecular profiling using multiple computational and statistical analyses revealed distinct polymorphisms in the Indian prostate cancer cohort. The mutational signatures identified provide a valuable resource for prognostic stratification and targeted treatment strategies for Indian prostate cancer patients. The DNA repair enzyme, POLQ, was identified as the druggable target in this study.\",\n"," 'HPLC fluorescence assay for measuring the activity of NAPE-PLD and the action of inhibitors affecting this enzyme.N-Acyl phosphatidylethanolamine-hydrolyzing phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD) is the major enzyme for the biosynthesis of the endocannabinoid anandamide. The role of NAPE-PLD in various physiological and pathophysiological conditions is currently under investigation. For example, the enzyme might be involved in the control of neuronal activity, embryonic development and pregnancy, and prostate cancer. We synthesized a novel NAPE-PLD substrate with a fluorogenic pyrene substituent at the N-acyl residue as tool compound for studying this enzyme. As shown by HPLC with fluorescence detection, in rat brain microsomes the substrate was transformed into the expected pyrene-labeled N-acylethanolamine (NAE), but minor amounts of three by-products could also be detected. In the presence of pan-serine hydrolase and secretory phospholipase A(2) inhibitors, the generation of these compounds, whose identity was verified using reference substances, was abolished. Based on these results, a method for determining the activity of NAPE-PLD was developed, validated, and applied to evaluate the action of known inhibitors of this enzyme. With human sperm, it was shown that the fluorescent substrate can also be used to study NAPE metabolism in intact cells.',\n"," 'The association between dairy products consumption and prostate cancer risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis.In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis to estimate the relationship between the consumption of dairy products and the risk of prostate cancer. We searched PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases for relevant articles and identified a total of thirty-three cohort studies between 1989 and 2020. The qualities of included studies were assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Pooled adjusted relative risks (RR) with 95 % CI were calculated. We performed subgroup analyses stratified by dairy type, prostate cancer type, follow-up years, treatment era, collection times, adjustment for confounders and geographic location. In the subgroup analysis stratified by prostate cancer type, the pooled RR were 0·98 (95 % CI 0·94, 1·03) in the advanced group, 1·10 (95 % CI 0·98, 1·24) in the non-advanced group and 0·92 (95 % CI 0·84, 1·00) in the fatal group. In the dose-response analysis, a positive association for the risk of prostate cancer was observed for total dairy products 400 g/d (RR: 1·02; 95 % CI 1·00, 1·03), total milk 200 g/d (RR: 1·02; 95 % CI 1·01, 1·03), cheese 40 g/d (RR: 1·01; 95 % CI 1·00, 1·03) and butter 50 g/d (RR: 1·03; 95 % CI 1·01, 1·05). A decreased risk was observed for the intake of whole milk 100 g/d (RR: 0·97; 95 % CI 0·96, 0·99). Our meta-analysis suggests that high intakes of dairy products may be associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer; however, since many of the studies were affected by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening bias, additional studies with an adjustment of PSA screening are needed.',\n"," \"Investigation of the regulatory effects of synthesized antisense oligonucleotides on androgen receptor (AR) exon 3 splicing in prostate cancer cells.The Androgen Receptor (AR) gene plays a key role in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Controlling the progression of CRPC by inhibiting AR gene expression is one of the core directions for prostate cancer (Pca) drug development. A 23-amino acids retention, named exon 3a, into the DNA binding domain of the splice variant AR23 has been shown to prevent AR from entering the nucleus and restore the sensitivity of cancer cells to related therapies. In this study, we conducted a preliminary investigation of the splicing modulation of the AR gene in order to develop a splice-switching therapy for Pca by promoting exon 3a inclusion. Using mutagenesis-coupled RT-PCR with AR minigene and over-expression of certain splicing factors, we found that serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins are key factors facilitating the recognition of the 3' splice site of exon 3a (L-3' SS), while the deletion or blocking of the polypyrimidine tract (PPT) region of the original 3' splice site of exon 3 (S-3' SS) could strongly enhance exon 3a splicing without affecting the function of any SR protein. Furthermore, we designed a series of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to screen drug candidates, and ASOs targeting S-3' SS and its PPT region or the exonic region of exon 3 turned out to be most effective in rescuing exon 3a splicing. A dose-response test indicated ASO12 as the lead candidate drug significantly promoting the inclusion of exon 3a to more than 85%. MTT assay confirmed that the cell proliferation was significantly inhibited after ASO treatment. Our results provide the first glance to AR splicing regulation. With several promising therapeutic ASO candidates obtained here, further development of ASO drugs to treat CRPC is strongly encouraged.\",\n"," \"Qingdai Decoction suppresses prostate cancer growth in lethal-stage prostate cancer models.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Contemporary therapy for advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) employs reagents such as enzalutamide and abiraterone acetate targeting the androgen receptor (AR) transcription axis only provide a temporary response and rapidly develop resistance. Additionally, neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is an AR pathway-independent and lethal-stage prostate cancer with no standard therapy. Qingdai Decoction (QDT), a traditional Chinese medicine formula, has various pharmacological activities and was widely used for the treatment of different diseases including prostatitis which may contribute to prostate cancer development. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aims to explore the anti-tumor role and potential mechanism of QDT on prostate cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: CRPC prostate cancer cell models and xenograft mice models were established for research. The effect of TCMs on cancer growth and metastasis were determined by CCK-8, wound-healing assays and the PC3-xenografted mice model. The toxicity of QDT in the major organs was investigated by H&E staining. The compound-target network was analyzed with network pharmacology. The correlation of QDT targets with prostate cancer patient's prognosis was analyzed with multiple prostate cancer patient cohorts. The expression of related proteins and mRNA were detected by western blot and real-time PCR. The gene knockdown was achieved with CRISPR-Cas13 technology. RESULTS: By integrating functional screening, network pharmacology analysis, CRISPR-Cas13 directed RNA targeting, and molecular biology validation in different prostate cancer models and clinical prostate cancer cohorts, we found that Qingdai Decoction (QDT), a Traditional Chinese Medicine, can repress cancer growth in advanced prostate cancer models in vitro and in vivo in an AR independent manner by targeting NOS3, TGFB1, and NCOA2. CONCLUSION: This study not only identified QDT as a novel drug for lethal-stage prostate cancer treatment but also provided an extensive Integrative research paradigm for investigating the roles and mechanisms of TCMs for the treatment of other diseases.\",\n"," 'Sympathetic β(2)-adrenergic receptor blockade overcomes docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer.PURPOSE: Due to the limited effective therapies, resistance to docetaxel is ordinarily fatal and remains a critical clinical challenge.β2-adrenergic receptor(β2-AR)can promote the metastasis and invasion of prostate cancer, but the role in chemotherapy-resistant prostate cancer remains unclear. METHODS: By downloading the GEO database in NCBI, the expression of β2-AR in different prostate tissues was analyzed. We constructed docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cell lines by the method of dose-escalation. LC3B-labeled stable cells and shAtg5 knockdown stable cells were constructed by lentivirus infection. The molecular mechanism of β2-AR affecting docetaxel sensitivity through apoptosis and autophage were investigated by flow cytometry, mitochondrial membrane potential and western blot. Then we detected the interaction between autophagy and apoptotic by performing immunoprecipitation assay. RESULTS: We show that restraining the activity of β(2)-AR sensitized the cell response and reduced the resistance to docetaxel. The mechanism involves the regulation of β(2)-AR in the cellular response to docetaxel through apoptosis and autophagy via caspase signaling and Atg5/AMPK/mTOR pathway as well as the effect of β(2)-AR on the crosstalk between apoptosis and autophagy via p38 MAPK and JNK/c-Jun/FOXO3a signaling pathways. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that β(2)-AR inhibitor-induced autophagy and apoptosis contribute to the effectiveness responses to docetaxel in castration-resistant prostate cancer, and in combination with pharmacological agents of β(2)-AR and autophagy inhibitors may provide a potential therapeutic strategy to enhance the limited capacity of docetaxel to control castration-resistant prostate cancer.',\n"," 'Association between major discrimination and deficit accumulation in African American cancer survivors: The Detroit Research on Cancer Survivors Study.BACKGROUND: Discrimination can adversely affect health and accelerate aging, but little is known about these relationships in cancer survivors. This study examines associations of discrimination and aging among self-identified African American survivors. METHODS: A population-based sample of 2232 survivors 20-79\\xa0years old at diagnosis were enrolled within 5 years of breast (n\\xa0=\\xa0787), colorectal (n\\xa0=\\xa0227), lung (n\\xa0=\\xa0223), or prostate (n\\xa0=\\xa0995) cancer between 2017 and 2022. Surveys were completed post-active therapy. A deficit accumulation index measured aging-related disease and function (score range, 0-1, where <0.20 is robust, 0.20 to <0.35 is pre-frail, and 0.35+ is frail; 0.06 is a large clinically meaningful difference). The discrimination scale assessed ever experiencing major discrimination and seven types of events (score, 0-7). Linear regression tested the association of discrimination and deficit accumulation, controlling for age, time from diagnosis, cancer type, stage and therapy, and sociodemographic variables. RESULTS: Survivors were an average of 62\\xa0years old (SD, 9.6), 63.2% reported ever experiencing major discrimination, with an average of 2.4 (SD, 1.7) types of discrimination events. Only 24.4% had deficit accumulation scores considered robust (mean score, 0.30 [SD, 0.13]). Among those who reported ever experiencing major discrimination, survivors with four to seven types of discrimination events (vs. 0-1) had a large, clinically meaningful increase in adjusted deficits (0.062, p\\xa0<\\xa0.001) and this pattern was consistent across cancer types. CONCLUSION: African American cancer survivors have high deficit accumulated index scores, and experiences of major discrimination were positively associated with these deficits. Future studies are needed to understand the intersectionality between aging, discrimination, and cancer survivorship among diverse populations.',\n"," \"Shrink polymer based electrochemical sensor for point-of-care detection of prostate-specific antigen.There is a growing but unmet need for point-of-care detection of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in body fluid which may facilitate early diagnosis and therapy of prostate cancer in a cost-effective and user-friendly way. Low sensitivity and narrow detection range limits applications of point-of-care testing in practice. Here, an immunosensor is first presented based on shrink polymer and integrated into a miniaturized electrochemical platform for detecting PSA in clinical samples. The sensing electrode was prepared by sputtering a gold film on shrink polymer, followed by heating to shrink the electrode to a small size with wrinkles from nano-scale to micro-scale. These wrinkles can be directly regulated by the thickness of the gold film with high specific areas for enhancement of antigen-antibody binding (3.9 times). A distinct difference between electrochemical active surface area (EASA) and response to PSA of shrink electrodes was observed and discussed. The electrode was treated with air plasma and modified with self-assembled graphene to further enhance the sensor's sensitivity (10.4 times). The shrink sensor with gold 200\\xa0nm thick integrated into the portable system was validated by a label-free immunoassay for detection of PSA in 20\\xa0μL serum within 35\\xa0mins. It exhibited a limit of detection of 0.38\\xa0fg/mL, the lowest among label-free PSA sensors, and a wide linear response from 10\\xa0fg/mL to 1000\\xa0ng/mL. Moreover, the sensor demonstrated reliable assay results in clinical serums, comparable to the commercial chemiluminescence instrument, confirming its feasibility for clinical diagnosis.\",\n"," 'Biosynthesis and characterization of polysaccharide-capped silver nanoparticles from Acalypha indica L. and evaluation of their biological activities.Biosynthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are gaining popularity due to their distinctive biological applications. In this research work, an eco-friendly method of synthesizing AgNPs from the leaf polysaccharide (PS) of Acalypha indica L. ( A. indica) was carried out. Synthesis of polysaccharide-AgNPs (PS-AgNPs) was indicated by visual detection of colour change from pale yellow to light brown. The PS-AgNPs were characterized with different techniques and further evaluated for biological activities. The Ultra violet-visible (UV-Vis.) spectroscopy expressed a sharp absorption peak at 415\\xa0nm confirmed the synthesis. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis revealed the size range of particles from 14\\xa0nm to 85\\xa0nm. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis detected the presence of various functional groups. The cubic crystalline structure of PS-AgNPs was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the particles were found to be oval to polymorphic shaped through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with sizes from 7.25\\xa0nm to 92.51\\xa0nm. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) determined the presence of silver in PS-AgNPs. The zeta potential was -28.0\\xa0mV, which confirmed the stability and an average particle size of 62.2\\xa0nm was calculated through dynamic light scattering (DLS). Lastly, the thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) showed the PS-AgNPs were resistant to high temperature. The PS-AgNPs exhibited significant free radical scavenging activity with an IC(50) value of 112.91\\xa0μg/ml. They were highly capable of inhibiting the growth of different bacterial and plant fungal pathogens and also active to reduce the cell viability of prostate cancer (PC-3) cell line. The IC(50) value was 101.43\\xa0μg/ml. The flow cytometric apoptosis analysis revealed the percentage of viable, apoptotic and necrotic cells of PC-3\\xa0cell line. According to this evaluation, it can be concluded that these biosynthesized and environmentally friendly PS-AgNPs are helpful to improve therapeutics because of significant antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant, and cytotoxic properties to open up new possibilities for euthenics.',\n"," 'Sensitive determination of prostate-specific antigen with graphene quantum dot-based fluorescence aptasensor using few-layer V(2)CT(x) MXene as quencher.A novel fluorescence aptasensor of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was established using few-layer vanadium carbide (FL-V(2)CT(x)) nanosheet as a quencher. First, FL-V(2)CT(x) was prepared by the delamination of multi-layer V(2)CT(x) (ML-V(2)CT(x)) with tetramethylammonium hydroxide. The aptamer-carboxyl graphene quantum dots (CGQDs) probe was prepared by combining the aminated PSA aptamer and CGQDs. Then, the aptamer-CGQDs were absorbed onto the surface of FL-V(2)CT(x) by hydrogen bond interaction, which led to the decrease in fluorescence of aptamer-CGQDs due to photoinduced energy transfer. After addition of PSA, PSA-aptamer-CGQDs complex was released from FL-V(2)CT(x). The fluorescence intensity of aptamer-CGQDs-FL-V(2)CT(x) with PSA was higher than that without PSA. The FL-V(2)CT(x)-based fluorescence aptasensor provided a PSA detection linear range from 0.1 to 20\\xa0ng\\xa0mL(-1) with detection limit of 0.03\\xa0ng\\xa0mL(-1). The ΔF value of fluorescence intensities for aptamer-CGQDs-FL-V(2)CT(x) with and without PSA was 5.6, 3.7, 7.7, and 5.4 times of ML-V(2)CT(x), few-layer titanium carbide (FL-Ti(3)C(2)T(x)), ML-Ti(3)C(2)T(x) and graphene oxide aptasensors, respectively, indicating the advantage of FL-V(2)CT(x). The aptasensor had high selectivity for PSA detection compared with some proteins and tumor markers. This proposed method had convenience and high sensitivity for PSA determination. The determination results of PSA in human serum samples using the aptasensor were consistent with those by chemiluminescent immunoanalysis. The fluorescence aptasensor can be successfully applied for PSA determination in serum samples of prostate cancer patients.',\n"," 'New autonomous and self-signaling biosensing device for sarcosine detection.An early diagnosis is the gold standard for cancer survival. Biosensors have proven their effectiveness in monitoring cancer biomarkers but are still limited to a series of requirements. This work proposes an integrated power solution, with an autonomous and self-signaling biosensing device. The biorecognition element is produced in situ by molecular imprinting to detect sarcosine, a known biomarker for prostate cancer. The biosensor was assembled on the counter-electrode of a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), simultaneously using EDOT and Pyrrole as monomers for the biomimetic process and the catalytic reduction of triiodide in the DSSC. After the rebinding assays, the hybrid DSSC/biosensor displayed a linear behavior when plotting the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and the charge transfer resistance (R(CT)) against the logarithm of the concentration of sarcosine. The latter obtained a sensitivity of 0.468\\xa0Ω/decade of sarcosine concentration, with a linear range between 1 ng/mL and 10 μg/mL, and a limit of detection of 0.32 ng/mL. When interfacing an electrochromic cell, consisting of a PEDOT-based material, with the hybrid device, a color gradient between 1 ng/mL and 10 μg/mL of sarcosine was observed. Thus, the device can be used anywhere with access to a light source, completely equipment-free, suitable for point-of-care analysis and capable of detecting sarcosine within a range of clinical interest.',\n"," 'A sensitive label-free biosensor based on Ag(2)S-sensitived Bi(2)WO(6)/BiOBr heterojunction for photoelectrochemical immunoassay of prostate specific antigen.Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world, and its early diagnosis can effectively reduce mortality. A new label-free photoelectrochemical (PEC) immunosensor on the basis of Bi(2)WO(6)/BiOBr nanocomposite materials has been successfully prepared for the test of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in human serum in this work. The Ag(2)S-sensitized Bi(2)WO(6)/BiOBr heterojunction was used as a photosensitive material, which effectively improved the photocurrent response. On Bi(2)WO(6)/BiOBr surface, dopamine immobilized PSA antibody by self-polymerizing to form polydopamine membrane. Antigen and antibody are specifically combined to achieve quantitative detection of PSA according to the current changes at different concentrations of antigen. Under the optimal experimental conditions, the PEC immunosensor has an ideal linear relationship between 1\\xa0pg/mL - 50\\xa0ng/mL, and the detection limit is 0.084\\xa0pg/mL. In addition, the prepared immunosensor has good stability, reproducibility and selectivity, providing a new method for the detection of PSA in actual sample analysis.',\n"," 'Multimodal convolutional neural networks based on the Raman spectra of serum and clinical features for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer.We collected surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) data from the serum of 729 patients with prostate cancer or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), corresponding to their pathological results, and built an artificial intelligence-assisted diagnosis model based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). We then evaluated its value in diagnosing prostate cancer and predicting the Gleason score (GS) using a simple cross-validation method. Our CNN model based on the spectral data for prostate cancer diagnosis revealed an accuracy of 85.14\\xa0±\\xa00.39%. After adjusting the model with patient age and prostate specific antigen (PSA), the accuracy of the multimodal CNN was up to 88.55\\xa0±\\xa00.66%.

In a phase I/II study on de novo metastatic prostate cancer we found that a human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) vaccine induced an early immune response in most of the patients. Here we present the results from the long-term monitoring of the immune responses and clinical outcomes. Twenty-two men with ISUP 4 to 5 and lymph node and/or bone metastases were treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), radiotherapy and the hTERT vaccine UV1 between January 2013 and July 2014. Immune response was monitored before, during and after vaccination and continued every 6 months until PSA progression. All patients had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline, and after 6 months, 1 and 2\\u2009years, and at progression. The clinical outcome was time to progression, overall survival and prostate cancer-specific survival. The median follow-up was 62\\u2009months (range: 19-101). At the last observation, nine of the 22 patients were still alive. Six have no progression, two have castration-resistant disease treated with second-line ADT and one has castration-refractory disease. Median time to PSA progression was 21\\u2009months, median overall survival was 62\\u2009months and median prostate cancer-specific survival was 84\\u2009months. Lack of immune response was an independent marker of prostate cancer death. The long-term monitoring showed that some patients had unanticipated subsequent high immune responses without developing recurrence. This association indicates that there might be a clinical benefit of hTERT vaccination in a subgroup of men with primary metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer treated with ADT and radiotherapy.',\n"," \"Histone methyltransferase KMT2D promotes prostate cancer progression through paracrine IL-6 signaling.Histone methyltransferase KMT2D plays a critical role as a human oncogene in prostate cancer (PCa). Dysregulated inflammatory responses and cytokine signaling are implicated in cancer progression. Furthermore, interleukin 6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine that contributes to PCa progression; however, the association between KMT2D and IL-6 in PCa remains unclear. PCa cell proliferative potential, migratory potential, and apoptosis in\\xa0vitro were determined using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), EdU incorporation, wound healing, and apoptosis assays. Proliferation and migratory potential were impaired and apoptosis was induced in PCa cells cultured with the conditioned medium from KMT2D-depleted cells. Cytokine array analysis showed that IL-6 was the most affected cytokine in the conditioned media. KMT2D knockdown significantly downregulated the expression of IL-6 in PCa cells. What's more, proliferation and migration were also impaired and apoptosis was also induced by silencing IL-6R expression. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were performed to validate the positive correlation between KMT2D and IL-6 in PCa tissue samples. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-PCR demonstrated that KMT2D and H3K4me1 occupied IL-6 enhancer regions and therefore, directly regulated IL-6 expression. The present study revealed that the KMT2D knockdown suppressed prostate cancer progression through the downregulation of paracrine IL-6 signaling. These results suggest that KMT2D could be regarded as a potential new target for PCa therapy.\",\n"," 'Discovery of a novel 1H-pyrazole inhibitor with potential anti-prostate cancer activity that perturbs the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT pathway.Lysine demethylase 5B (KDM5B) is a member of the Jumonji AT-rich interactive domain 1 family. Its main function is to demethylate di/trimethyl histone H3 lysine 4 and it plays a crucial role in the occurrence and development of cancer. In this study, we performed structure-based optimization of KDM5B inhibitors based on our previous work and the most active compound we synthesized was 11ad. Molecular modeling studies and thermal shift assays revealed that 11ad specifically targets KDM5B at the molecular and cellular levels. Crucially, 11ad demonstrated good pharmacokinetic properties and anti-prostate cancer activity in a xenograft model. Furthermore, unexpectedly, the specificity of 11ad for prostate cancer was found to be related to its inhibition of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT pathway. This is the first report of a KDM5B inhibitor affecting this pathway. Taken together, our findings indicate that 11ad is a novel KDM5B inhibitor that may serve as a lead compound for the development of treatments for prostate cancer.',\n"," \"Isotonic design for phase I cancer clinical trials with late-onset toxicities.This article addresses the problem of identifying the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in Phase I dose-finding clinical trials with late-onset toxicities. The main design challenge is how best to adaptively allocate study participants to tolerable doses when the evaluation window for the toxicity endpoint is long relative to the accrual rate of new participants. We propose a new design framework based on order-restricted statistical inference that addresses this challenge in sequential dose assignments. We illustrate the proposed method on real data from a Phase I trial of bortezomib in lymphoma patients and apply it to a Phase I trial of radiotherapy in prostate cancer patients. We conduct extensive simulation studies to compare our design's operating characteristics to existing published methods. Overall, our proposed design demonstrates good performance relative to existing methods in allocating participants at and around the MTD during the study and accurately recommending the MTD at the study conclusion.\",\n"," 'Editorial Comment: Environmental Impact of Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Transrectal Ultrasound Guided Prostate Biopsy.nan',\n"," 'Is it necessary for all patients with suspicious lesions undergo systematic biopsy in the era of MRI-TRUS fusion targeted biopsy?PURPOSE: Targeted biopsy (TB) combined with systematic biopsy (SB) is an optimized mode of prostate biopsy but can often lead to oversampling and overdiagnosis accompanied by potential biopsy-related complications and patient discomfort. Here, we attempted to reasonably stratify the patient population based on multi-parameter indicators with the aim of avoiding unnecessary SB. METHODS: In total, 340 biopsy-naïve men with suspected lesions, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) < 20 ng/mL and prostate imaging-reporting and data system (PI-RADS) ≥ 3 enrolled for study underwent both TB and SB. The primary outcome was to determine independent predictors for a valid diagnosis, assuming that only TB was performed and SB omitted (defined as mono-TB), taking TB + SB as the reference standard. The secondary outcomes were exploration of the predictive factors of mono-TB and TB + SB in detection of prostate cancer (PCa) and clinically significant PCa (csPCa). RESULTS: The mean PSA density (PSAD) of patient group was 0.27 ng/mL/mL. Multiparametric MRI PI-RADS scores were 3-5 in 146 (42.94%), 105 (30.88%), and 89 (26.18%) cases, respectively. PCa and csPCa were detected in 178/340 (52.35%) and 162/340 (47.65%) patients, respectively. Overall, 116/178 (65.17%) patients diagnosed with PCa displayed pathological consistencies between mono-TB and TB + SB modes. PSAD and PI-RADS were independent predictors of valid diagnosis using mono-TB. CONCLUSIONS: PSAD combined with PI-RADS showed utility in guiding optimization of the prostate biopsy mode. Higher PSAD and PI-RADS values were associated with greater confidence in implementing mono-TB and safely omitting SB, thus effectively balancing the benefits and risks.',\n"," 'Complication rates of transrectal and transperineal prostate fusion biopsies there a learning curve even in high volume interventional center?PURPOSE: To analyze the learning curve regarding complication rates of transrectal prostate biopsy (TRPB) versus transperineal prostate biopsy (TPPB), using real time software-based magnetic resonance imaging ultrasound (MRI-US) fusion techniques, along with first year experience of transperineal approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS: retrospective unicentric cohort study at a quaternary care hospital. Medical records of all consecutive patients that underwent TPPB between March 2021 and February 2022, after the introduction of MRI-US fusion device, and those who underwent TRPB throughout the entire years of 2019 and 2020 were analyzed. All complications that occurred as consequences of the procedure were considered. Descriptive statistics, Chi-squared and Fisher tests were used to describe complications and compare the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 283 patients were included in the transperineal group and 513 in the transrectal group. The analysis of a learning curve for the transperineal method showed lower complications rates comparing the first six months of TPPB procedures (group 1); The complication rate for TPPB was lower than that of TRPB (55.1% versus 81.9%, respectively; p<0.01). TPPB showed specifically lower rates of hematuria (48.8% versus 66.3%;p<0.001) and rectal bleeding(3.5% versus 18.1%; p<0.001). There were no cases of prostatitis after transperineal biopsies and three cases (0.6%) after transrectal procedures. CONCLUSIONS: We evidenced the learning curve for performing the transperineal biopsy, with a lower rate of complications for the experienced team, after 142 cases after 6 months of practice. The lower complication rate of TPPB and the absence of infectious prostatitis imply a safer procedure when compared to TRPB.',\n"," 'Effects of In-office Dispensing by Single-specialty Urology Practices on Management of Advanced Prostate Cancer.INTRODUCTION: We examine changes in the volume of patients with advanced prostate cancer and prescriptions for abiraterone and enzalutamide among urology practices with and without in-office dispensing. METHODS: Using data from the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs, we identified in-office dispensing by single-specialty urology practices from 2011 to 2018. As the greatest growth in implementing dispensing occurred among large groups in 2015, outcomes were measured at the practice level in 2014 (before) and 2016 (after) for dispensing and non-dispensing practices. Outcomes included the volume of men with advanced prostate cancer managed by a practice and prescriptions for abiraterone and/or enzalutamide. Using national Medicare data, generalized linear mixed models were fit to compare the practice-level ratio of each outcome (2016 relative to 2014) adjusting for regional contextual factors. RESULTS: In-office dispensing increased from 1% to 30% of single-specialty urology practices from 2011 to 2018, with 28 practices implementing dispensing in 2015. In 2016 compared to 2014, adjusted changes in the volume of patients with advanced prostate cancer managed by a practice were similar between non-dispensing (0.88, 95% CI 0.81-0.94) and dispensing (0.93, 95% CI 0.76-1.09) practices (P = .60). Prescriptions for abiraterone and/or enzalutamide increased in both non-dispensing (2.00, 95% CI 1.58-2.41) and dispensing (8.99, 95% CI 4.51-13.47) practices (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: In-office dispensing is increasingly common in urology practices. This emerging model is not associated with changes in patient volume but is associated with increased prescriptions for abiraterone and enzalutamide.',\n"," '(68)Ga-PSMA PET/CT and Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: Which SUVmax Value?BACKGROUND/AIM: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of (68)Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in the diagnosis and staging of prostate cancer (PCa). PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 2021 to December 2022, 160 men (median age: 66 years) with PCa (median PSA of 11.7 ng/ml) before prostate biopsy underwent (68)Ga-PET/CT imaging examinations (Biograph 6; Siemens, Knoxville, TN, USA). The location of focal uptake on (68)Ga-PSMA PET/TC and standardized uptake values (SUVmax) were reported on a per-lesion basis for each International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade group (GG) PCa. RESULTS: Overall, the median intraprostatic (68)Ga-PSMA SUVmax was 26.1 (range=2.7-164); in the 15 men with not clinically significant PCa (ISUP grade group 1) median SUVmax was 7.5 (range=2.7-12.5). In the 145 men with csPCa (ISUP GG≥2) median SUVmax was 33 (range=7.8-164). A SUVmax cut-off of 8 demonstrated a diagnostic accuracy in the diagnosis of PCa equal to 87.7% vs. 89.3% vs. 100% in the presence of a GG1 vs. GG2 vs. GG≥3 PCa, respectively. In addition, median SUVmax in the bone and node metastases was 52.7 (range=25.3-92.8) and 47 (range=24.5-65), respectively. CONCLUSION: (68)GaPSMA PET/CT with a SUVmax cut-off of 8 demonstrated a good accuracy in the diagnosis of csPCa (100% in the presence of GG≥3) showing a good cost-benefit ratio as a single procedure for the diagnosis and staging of high-risk PCa.',\n"," 'Sarcopenia and the Therapeutic Effects of Androgen Receptor-axis-targeted Therapies in Patients With Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.BACKGROUND/AIM: Sarcopenia is a syndrome characterized by the progressive and generalized loss of skeletal muscle mass and has been reported to be a poor prognostic factor for taxane-treated castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, whether sarcopenia affects androgen receptor axis-targeted therapies (ARATs) remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated the association between sarcopenia in CRPC and treatment outcomes of ARATs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 2015 to September 2022, 127 patients who received ARATs as 1st-line treatment for CRPC at our two hospitals were included in the study. We retrospectively evaluated sarcopenia using computed tomography images and investigated whether sarcopenia affects the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with CRPC treated with ARATs. RESULTS: Out of 127 patients, 99 were diagnosed with sarcopenia. The PFS of the sarcopenic group administered ARATs was significantly better than that of the non-sarcopenic group. Furthermore, in the multivariate analysis of PFS, sarcopenia was an independent favourable prognostic factor. However, there was no significant difference in the OS between the sarcopenic and non-sarcopenia groups. CONCLUSION: ARATs could more effectively treat patients with CRPC and sarcopenia than patients with CRPC without sarcopenia. Sarcopenia may positively influence the therapeutic effects of ARATs.',\n"," \"Prevalence and Risk Factors of Emotional Distress in Patients With Prostate Cancer Assigned to External-beam Radiotherapy With or Without High-dose Rate Brachytherapy.BACKGROUND/AIM: Upcoming radiotherapy for prostate cancer may lead to emotional distress. This study aimed to identify the prevalence and risk factors in a retrospective cohort of 102 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirteen characteristics were evaluated for six emotional problems. To account for multiple comparisons, Bonferroni correction was used; p-values <0.0038 were significant (alpha level <0.05). RESULTS: Prevalence of worry, fears, sadness, depression, nervousness, and loss of interest in usual activities was 25%, 27%, 11%, 11%, 18%, and 5%, respectively. A greater number of physical problems was significantly associated with worry (p=0.0037) and fears (p<0.0001) and showed trends regarding sadness (p=0.011) and depression (p=0.011). Trends were also found for associations between younger age and worry (p=0.021), advanced primary tumor stage and fears (p=0.025), patient's history of another malignancy and nervousness (p=0.035), and between external-beam radiotherapy alone and fears (p=0.042) or nervousness (p=0.037). CONCLUSION: Although the prevalence of emotional distress was comparably low, patients with risk factors may benefit from early psychological support.\",\n"," \"Reinforcement of the Tumor Suppressing Properties of microRNA-1 by Substitution at the C2' Position of Varying Ribose Residues in Chemically Synthesized microRNA-1 Molecules.BACKGROUND/AIM: Tumor suppressive microRNAs (miR) are frequently down-regulated during cancer development. The application of synthetic miR molecules restoring suppressed miR, therefore, opens up innovative possibilities in future anticancer therapy. The potential application, however, is limited by the instability of RNA molecules. The presented proof-of-principle study evaluates the potential of using synthetic chemically modified miR molecules as anticancer drugs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chemically synthesized miR-1 molecules containing two 2'-O-RNA modifications, 2'-O-methyl- and 2'-fluoro-derivatives, introduced at different positions of the 3'-terminus, were transfected into prostate cancer (PC) cells (LNCaP, PC-3). Detectability was measured by quantitative RT-PCR. The effect of modifications regarding the growth inhibitory activity of miR-1 was investigated by cell growth kinetics with transfected PC cells. RESULTS: All variants of synthetic modified miR-1 could be transfected into PC cells and were detectable by RT-PCR. Depending on the chemical modification, but especially on the position of the modification, the growth inhibitory activity of synthetic modified miR-1 was increased compared to synthetic unmodified miR-1. CONCLUSION: Synthetic miR-1 can be enhanced in its biological activity by modification of the C2'-OH group. This depends on the chemical substituent, the position and number of substituted nucleotides. The molecular fine-tuning of tumor suppressive miR like miR-1 may represent a promising approach for the development of multi-targeting nucleic acid-based drugs for cancer therapy.\",\n"," \"In Vivo Dosimetry in the Urethra During Prostate Carbon Ion Radiotherapy.BACKGROUND/AIM: In vivo dosimetry can prevent dose delivery errors by directly measuring the dose of radiation administered to a patient. However, a method for in vivo dosimetry during carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) has not been established. Therefore, we investigated data from in vivo dosimetry of the urethra during CIRT for prostate cancer using small spherical diode dosimeters (SSDDs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included five patients enrolled in a clinical trial (jRCT identifier: jRCTs032190180) on which the use of four-fraction CIRT for prostate cancer was examined. The urethral dose during CIRT for prostate cancer was measured using the SSDDs inserted into the ureteral catheter. The relative error between the in vivo and calculated doses obtained using the Xio-N treatment planning system was determined. Additionally, a dose-response stability test for the in vivo dosimeter was performed under clinical conditions. RESULTS: The relative error between the in vivo and calculated urethral doses ranged from 6 to 12%. The dose-response stability under clinical conditions of the measured dose was ≤1%. Therefore, an error >1% would be due to an interfractional patient setup error in the large dose gradient in the urethra. CONCLUSION: The usefulness of in vivo dosimetry using SSDDs in CIRT and SSDDs' potential for detecting dose delivery errors during CIRT is herein highlighted.\",\n"," 'Combination of Urinary MiR-501 and MiR-335 With Current Clinical Diagnostic Parameters as Potential Predictive Factors of Prostate Biopsy Outcome.BACKGROUND: The detection of prostate cancer (PCa) is currently based on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) quantification as an initial screening followed by ultrasound-guided transrectal biopsy. However, the high rate of false-negative biopsies often leads to inappropriate treatment. Therefore, new molecular biomarkers, such as urine microRNAs (miRNAs), are a possible way to redefine PCa diagnostics. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Urine samples of 356 patients undergoing prostate biopsy (256 cases with confirmed prostate cancer, 100 cases with negative prostate biopsy) at the Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute (Czech Republic) and additional 36 control subjects (healthy controls, benign prostatic hyperplasia - BPH) were divided into the discovery and validation cohorts and analyzed. In the discovery phase, small RNA sequencing was performed using the QIAseq miRNA Library Kit and the NextSeq 500 platform. Identified miRNA candidates were validated by the RT-qPCR method in the independent validation phase. RESULTS: Using the small RNA sequencing method, we identified 12 urine miRNAs significantly dysregulated between PCa patients and controls. Furthermore, independent validation showed the ability of miR-501-3p and the quantitative miR-335:miR-501 ratio to distinguish between PCa patients and patients with negative prostate biopsy. The subsequent combination of the miR-335:miR-501 ratio with PSA and total prostate volume (TPV) using logistic regression exceeded the analytical accuracy of standalone parameters [area under curve (AUC)=0.75, positive predictive value (PPV)=0.85, negative predictive value (NPV)=0.51)] and discriminated patients according to biopsy outcome. CONCLUSION: Combination of miR-335:miR-501 ratio with PSA and total prostate volume was able to identify patients with negative prostate biopsy and could potentially streamline decision making for biopsy indication.',\n"," 'Chromosome-specific segment size alterations are determinants of prognosis in prostate cancer.Currently, risk stratification is the most difficult problem in prostate cancer (PCa) management. Gleason grading cannot adequately predict cancer progression. This study aimed to identify chromosome-specific segment size alterations that could aid risk stratification and predict metastasis using a retrospective cohort-study strategy. A binary logistic regression model was generated using 16 chromosome-specific segments with size alterations (deletions and amplifications) that showed associations with disease stage (primary versus metastatic). The regression model was trained with the MSKCC PIK3R1 PCa cohort (n\\xa0=\\xa01417), and validated with the TCGA Firehose Legacy (n\\xa0=\\xa0500), MSKCC Prostate Oncogenome Project (n\\xa0=\\xa0218), and the SU2C/PCF Dream Team (n\\xa0=\\xa0150) PCa cohorts. Furthermore, the capacity of the model to predict metastasis between primary tumours with metastasis (n\\xa0=\\xa054) and primary tumours without metastasis (n\\xa0=\\xa054) was tested. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the model at disease stage stratification ranged from 69.02% to 88.55%, 72.8% to 86.00% and 66.30% to 89.50%, respectively. The model also showed good performance at metastasis prediction with accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 57.41%, 62.96% and 51.85%, respectively. The study conclusion was that chromosome-specific segment size alterations can aid risk stratification and metastasis prediction. The significance of the study findings is that in combinations with clinical, biochemical, and histopathological variables, chromosome-specific alterations could improve current risk stratification and prediction models for PCa.',\n"," 'Prostate Cancer IRE Study (PRIS): A Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Focal Therapy to Radical Treatment in Localized Prostate Cancer.The aim of focal treatments (FTs) in prostate cancer (PCa) is to treat lesions while preserving surrounding benign tissue and anatomic structures. Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a nonthermal technique that uses high-voltage electric pulses to increase membrane permeability and induce membrane disruption in cells, which potentially causes less damage to the surrounding tissue in comparison to other ablative techniques. We summarize the study protocol for the Prostate Cancer IRE Study (PRIS), which involves two parallel randomized controlled trials comparing IRE with (1) robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) or (2) radiotherapy in men with newly diagnosed intermediate-risk PCa (NCT05513443). To reduce the number of patients for inclusion and the study duration, the primary outcomes are functional outcomes: urinary incontinence in study 1 and irritative urinary symptoms in study 2. Providing evidence of the lower impact of IRE on functional outcomes will lay a foundation for the design of future multicenter studies with an oncological outcome as the primary endpoint. Erectile function, quality of life, treatment failure, adverse events, and cost effectiveness will be evaluated as secondary objectives. Patients diagnosed with Gleason score 3 + 4 or 4 + 3 PCa from a single lesion visible on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without any Gleason grade 4 or higher in systematic biopsies outside of the target (unifocal significant disease), aged ≥40 yr, with no established extraprostatic extension on multiparametric MRI, a lesion volume of <1.5 cm(3), prostate-specific antigen <20 ng/ml, and stage ≤T2b are eligible for inclusion.

Expressing chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) in immune cells, typically T lymphocytes, is a practical modification that drives an immune response against cancerous tissue. CAR-T efficacy is suboptimal in solid tumors due to the tumor microenvironment (TME) that limits T lymphocyte cytotoxicity. In this study, we demonstrate that neutrophils differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells modified with AAVS1-inserted CAR constructs showed a robust cytotoxic effect against prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expressing LNCaP cells as a model for prostate cancer in vitro. Our results suggest that engineered CAR can significantly enhance the neutrophil anti-tumor effect, providing a new avenue in treating prostate cancers.',\n"," 'Issues related to prostate cancer management.nan',\n"," 'Retraction Note: PlncRNA-1 induces apoptosis through the Her-2 pathway in prostate cancer cells.nan',\n"," 'Erratum for: Peritoneal Carcinomatosis of Prostate Cancer with PSMA-targeted (18)F-DCFPyL PET/CT.nan',\n"," 'Clinical Translation of Targeted α-Therapy: An Evolution or a Revolution?The field of radioligand therapy has advanced greatly in recent years, driven largely by β-emitting therapies targeting somatostatin receptor-expressing tumors and the prostate-specific membrane antigen.

The aim of this study is to develop a convolutional neural networks-based framework for fully-automated detection and segmentation of metastatic prostate cancer lesions in whole-body PET/CT images. METHODS: 525 whole-body PET/CT images of patients with metastatic prostate cancer were available for the study, acquired with the [(18)F]DCFPyL radiotracer that targets prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). U-Net (1)-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were trained to identify lesions on paired axial PET/CT slices. Baseline models were trained using batch-wise dice loss, as well as the proposed weighted batch-wise dice loss (wDice), and the lesion detection performance was quantified, with a particular emphasis on lesion size, intensity, and location. We used 418 images for model training, 30 for model validation, and 77 for model testing. In addition, we allowed our model to take n\\xa0=\\xa00,2, …, 12 neighboring axial slices to examine how incorporating greater amounts of 3D context influences model performance. We selected the optimal number of neighboring axial slices that maximized the detection rate on the 30 validation images, and trained five neural networks with different architectures. RESULTS: Model performance was evaluated using the detection rate, Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and sensitivity. We found that the proposed wDice loss significantly improved the lesion detection rate, lesion-wise DSC and lesion-wise sensitivity compared to the baseline, with corresponding average increases of 0.07 (p-value\\xa0=\\xa00.01), 0.03 (p-value\\xa0=\\xa00.01) and 0.04 (p-value\\xa0=\\xa00.01), respectively. The inclusion of the first two neighboring axial slices in the input likewise increased the detection rate by 0.17, lesion-wise DSC by 0.05, and lesion-wise mean sensitivity by 0.16. However, there was a minimal effect from including more distant neighboring slices. We ultimately chose to use a number of neighboring slices equal to 2 and the wDice loss function to train our final model. To evaluate the model's performance, we trained three models using identical hyperparameters on three different data splits. The results showed that, on average, the model was able to detect 80% of all testing lesions, with a detection rate of 93% for lesions with maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) greater than 5.0. In addition, the average median lesion-wise DSC was 0.51 and 0.60 for all the lesions and lesions with SUVmax>5.0, respectively, on the testing set. Four additional neural networks with different architectures were trained, and they both yielded stronger performance of segmenting lesions whose SUVmax>5.0 compared to the rest of lesions. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that prostate cancer metastases in PSMA PET/CT images can be detected and segmented using CNNs. The segmentation performance strongly depends on the intensity, size, and the location of lesions, and can be improved by using specialized loss functions. Specifically, the models performed best in detection of lesions with SUVmax>5.0. Another challenge was to accurately segment lesions close to the bladder. Future work will focus on improving the detection of lesions with lower SUV values by designing custom loss functions that take into account the lesion intensity, using additional data augmentation techniques, and reducing the number of false lesions by developing methods to better separate signal from noise.\",\n"," 'Prostate adenocarcinoma metastasis to the testis: A new case report.Prostate cancer (PCa) in the second most common cancer in men worldwide.

Lower total testosterone (TT) levels have been associated with increased PCa detection and worse pathological features after treatment. However, data from the Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) and Prostate Cancer Prevention (PCPT) trial groups indicate no association. The aim of this study is to investigate the association of serum androgen levels and PCa detection in a prospective screening study of men at higher genetic risk of aggressive PCa due to BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants (PVs), the IMPACT study. METHODS: Men enrolled in the IMPACT study provided serum samples during regular visits. Hormonal levels were calculated using immunoassays. Free testosterone (FT) was calculated from TT and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) using the Sodergard mass equation. Age, body mass index (BMI), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and hormonal concentrations were compared between genetic cohorts. We also explored associations between age and TT, SHBG, FT and PCa, in the whole subset and stratified by BRCA1/2 PVs status. RESULTS: A total of 777 participants in the IMPACT study had TT and SHBG measurements in serum samples at annual visits, giving 3940 prospective androgen levels, from 266 BRCA1 PVs carriers, 313 BRCA2 PVs carriers and 198 non-carriers. The median number of visits per patient was 5. There was no difference in TT, SHBG and FT between carriers and non-carriers. In a univariate analysis, androgen levels were not associated with PCa. In the analysis stratified by carrier status, no significant association was found between hormonal levels and PCa in non-carriers, BRCA1 or BRCA2 PVs carriers. CONCLUSIONS: Male BRCA1/2 PVs carriers have a similar androgen profile to non-carriers. Hormonal levels were not associated with PCa in men with and without BRCA1/2 PVs. Mechanisms related to the particularly aggressive phenotype of PCa in BRCA2 PVs carriers may therefore not be linked with circulating hormonal levels.',\n"," \"Impact of prebiopsy MRI on prostate cancer staging: Results from the Norwegian Prostate Cancer Registry.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to evaluate the 2015 introduction of prebiopsy magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate (MRI-P) as the standard of care for diagnosing prostate cancer (PCa) by the Norwegian public health care authorities. There were three specific objectives of this study: first, to evaluate the consequences of using different TNM manuals for clinical T-staging (cT-staging) in a national setting; second, to determine if the data reveals that MRI-P based cT-staging is superior to digital rectal examination (DRE)-based cT-staging compared with pathological T-stage (pT-stage) post radical prostatectomy; and third, to assess whether treatment allocations have changed over time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients registered in the Norwegian Prostate Cancer Registry between 2004 and 2021 were retrieved and 5538 were eligible for inclusion. Concordance between clinical T-stage (cT-stage) and pT-stage was assessed by percentage agreement, Cohen's kappa and Gwet's agreement. RESULTS: MR visualisation of lesions influences reporting of tumour extension beyond DRE findings. Agreement between cT-stage and pT-stage declined from 2004 to 2009, which coincided with an increase in the percentage being pT3. From 2010, agreement increased, which aligned with changes in cT-staging and the introduction of MRI-P. From 2017, regarding the reporting of cT-DRE and cT-Total (overall cT-stage), agreement diminished for cT-DRE but remained relatively stable (>60%) for cT-Total. Regarding treatment allocation, the study suggests that staging with MRI-P has shifted treatment towards radiotherapy in locally advanced high-risk disease. CONCLUSION: Introduction of MRI-P has affected cT-stage reporting. Agreement between cT-stage and pT-stage appears to have improved. This study suggests that use of MRI-P influences treatment decisions in certain patient subgroups.\",\n"," 'Diagnostic and cost-effectiveness of axial skeleton MRI in staging high-risk prostate cancer.INTRODUCTION: Current literature suggests that axial skeleton magnetic resonance imaging (AS-MRI) is more sensitive than Tc 99m bone scintigraphy (BS) for detecting bone metastases (BM) in high-risk prostate cancer (PCa). However, BS is still widely performed. Its diagnostic accuracy has been studied; however, its feasibility and cost implications are yet to be examined. METHODS: We reviewed all patients with high risk PCa undergoing AS-MRI over a 5-year period. AS-MRI was performed on patients with histologically confirmed PCa and either PSA\\u2009>\\u200920\\u2009ng/ml, Gleason ≥8, or TNM Stage ≥T3 or N1 disease. All AS-MRI studies were obtained using a 1.5-T AchievaPhilips™MRI scanner. We compared the AS-MRI positivity and equivocal rate with that of BS. Data were analysed according to Gleason score, T-stage and PSA. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to quantify the strength of association between positive scans and clinical variables. Feasibility and burden of expenditure was also evaluated. RESULTS: Five hundred three patients with a median age of 72 and a mean PSA of 34.8\\xa0ng/ml were analysed. Eighty-eight patients (17.5%) were positive for BM on AS-MRI (mean PSA 99 [95% CI 69.1-129.9]). Comparatively 409 patients (81.3%) were negative for BM on AS-MRI (mean PSA 24.7 (95% CI [21.7-27.7]) (p\\u2009=\\u20090.007); 1.2% (n\\u2009=\\u20096) of patients had equivocal results (mean PSA 33.4 [95% CI 10.5-56.3]). There was no significant difference in age (p\\u2009=\\u20090.122) between this group and patients with a positive scan, but there was a significant difference in PSA (p\\u2009=\\u20090.028), T stage (p\\u2009=\\u20090.006) and Gleason score (p\\u2009=\\u20090.023). In comparison with BS, AS-MRI detection rate was equivalent or higher compared with the literature. Based on NHS tariff calculations, there would be a minimum cost saving of £8406.89. All patients underwent AS-MRI within 14\\u2009days. CONCLUSION: The use of AS-MRI to stage BM in high-risk PCa is both feasible and results in a reduced burden of expenditure.',\n"," 'Stratifying the initial prostate cancer suspicion to avoid magnetic resonance exams by sequencing men according to serum prostate-specific antigen, digital rectal examination and the prostate-specific antigen density based on digital rectal prostate volume category.nan',\n"," \"Clinical outcomes of anterior prostate cancers treated with robotic assisted radical prostatectomy.INTRODUCTION: A prospective cohort study comparing peri outcomes for patients with predominantly anterior prostate cancer (APC) identified preoperatively against non-anterior prostate cancer (NAPC) treated via robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of the 757 RARP's completed between January 2016 and April 2018, two comparative cohorts for anterior and an equivalent group of non-anterior prostate tumours each consisting of 152 patients were compared against each other. Data were collected on the following variables: patient age; operating consultant; preoperative PSA, ISUP grade, degree of nerve sparing; tumour staging; presence and location of positive surgical margins; PSA density, postoperative ISUP grade; treatment paradigm and postoperative PSA, erectile function, and continence outcomes with 2-year follow-up. RESULTS: APCs were found to have significantly lower ISUP grading postoperatively; increased diagnosis via active surveillance over new diagnosis; more frequently undertaken bilateral nerve-sparing and long-term poorer continence outcomes at 18 and 24\\u2009months postoperatively (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Pre- and post-op PSA levels, erectile function, PSA density, positive surgical margins (PSM), age and tumour staging showed no significant differences between the APC and NAPC cohorts (p\\u2009>\\u20090.05). CONCLUSION: The lower ISUP grading could indicate APC as overall being less aggressive than NAPC, whereas the poorer long-term continence outcomes require further investigating. The non-significant differences amongst tumour staging, PSA density, preoperative PSA levels and PSM rates suggest that APC may not be as significant as predicted in diagnostic evaluation. Overall, this study provides useful information on the growing literature of anterior prostate cancer. Being the largest comparative cohort study to date on APC post-RARP, these results indicate the true characteristics of anterior tumours and their functional outcomes to help improve education, patient expectations and management.\",\n"," 'Genomic alterations in neuroendocrine prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.BACKGROUND: Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is a lethal subtype of prostate cancer. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the prevalence of genomic alterations in NEPC and better understand its molecular features to potentially inform precision medicine. METHODS: EMBASE, PubMed, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched for eligible studies until March 2022. Study qualities were assessed using the Q-genie tool. The prevalence of gene mutations and copy number alterations (CNAs) were extracted, and meta-analysis was performed using R Studio with meta package. RESULTS: A total of 14 studies with 449 NEPC patients were included in this meta-analysis. The most frequently mutated gene in NEPC was TP53 (49.8%), and the prevalence of deleterious mutations in ATM/BRCA was 16.8%. Common CNAs in NEPC included RB1 loss (58.3%), TP53 loss (42.8%), PTEN loss (37.0%), AURKA amplification (28.2%), and MYCN amplification (22.9%). RB1/TP53 alterations and concurrent RB1 and TP53 alterations were remarkably common in NEPC, with a prevalence of 83.8% and 43.9%, respectively. Comparative analyses indicated that the prevalence of (concurrent) RB1/TP53 alterations was significantly higher in de novo NEPC than in treatment-emergent NEPC (t-NEPC). CONCLUSIONS: This study presents the comprehensive prevalence of common genomic alterations and potentially actionable targets in NEPC and reveals the genomic differences between de novo NEPC and t-NEPC. Our findings highlight the importance of genomic testing in patients for precision medicine and provide insights into future studies exploring different NEPC subtypes.',\n"," 'MRI of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: Important Pre Considerations.New minimally invasive techniques that reduce morbidity while improving lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) have become attractive alternatives for patients, in comparison to traditional techniques such as transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and simple prostatectomy. Pre- and postprocedural MRI is not routinely performed for LUTS due to BPH treatments. However, because of the combination of rapidly evolving treatments available for LUTS due to BPH and increasing demand for prebiopsy prostate MRI for detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (PCa), an understanding of procedural techniques and expected changes are important for accurate interpretation of prostate MRI performed after treatment of BPH. The authors discuss the imaging evaluation of LUTS due to BPH and emerging predictors of treatment success. The posttreatment appearance and underlying anatomic changes in the prostate after medical, surgical, and minimally invasive treatments including TURP, simple prostatectomy, laser enucleations and ablations, prostatic urethral lift, water vapor thermal therapy, and prostate artery embolization are detailed. Most procedures reduce prostate volume, notably in the periurethral prostatic tissue. Ablations create areas of necrosis and can distort the normal zonal anatomy between the transition zone and the peripheral zone, and prostate artery embolization creates infarcts in the transition zone. Mechanical prostatic urethral lift devices open the anterior channel at the bladder base but create susceptibility artifacts that can obscure and prevent detection of a lesion in the transition zone. Also discussed are the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer in the postprocedural prostate and imaging of BPH procedure complications such as urethral strictures, abscesses, and hematuria.

See the invited commentary by Purysko in this issue.',\n"," 'HP1α promotes the progression of prostate cancer.PURPOSE: Patients who have been diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCa) typically have a dismal outlook and few therapeutic choices available to them, because the precise pathogenesis of the disease is not yet fully understood. The presence of HP1α, also known as the heterochromatin protein 1α, is required for the creation of higher-order chromatin structures. However, little is known about HP1α that serves roles in the pathogenesis of PCa. The primary purpose of our research was to investigate alterations in the levels of HP1α expression and to plan a series of tests to validate the function of HP1α in PCa. METHOD: Information on HP1α expression in PCa and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissues were gathered using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) databases. RT-qPCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to assess HP1α mRNA and protein expression in several human PCa tissues and cell lines. The CCK8 assay, clone formation assay, and transwell assay were used to examine biological activities including cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. The expression of proteins connected to apoptosis and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was examined using Western blot. The tumorigenic effect of HP1α was also verified by in vivo experiments. RESULT: HP1α expression was much higher in PCa than in BPH tissues and cells, and was positively correlated with the Gleason score of PCa. In vitro experiments showed that HP1α knockdown could inhibit the ability of proliferation, invasion, and migration of PC3 and LNCaP cells, and promote cell apoptosis and EMT. In vivo experiments showed that HP1α knockdown inhibited tumorigenesis in mice. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that HP1α expression promotes PCa development and might be a novel therapeutic target for the diagnosis or treatment of PCa.',\n"," \"Current thoughts on cellular functions of numb-associated kinases.Members of the Numb-associated kinase family of serine/threonine kinases play an essential role in many cellular processes, such as endocytosis, autophagy, dendrite morphogenesis, osteoblast differentiation, and the regulation of the Notch pathway. Numb-associated kinases have been relevant to diverse diseases, including neuropathic pain, Parkinson's disease, and prostate cancer. Therefore, they are considered potential therapeutic targets. In addition, it is reported that Numb-associated kinases have been involved in the life cycle of multiple viruses such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), Ebola virus (EBOV), and dengue virus (DENV). Recently, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to threaten global health. Studies show that Numb-associated kinases are implicated in the infection of SARS-CoV-2 which can be suppressed by Numb-associated kinases inhibitors. Thus, Numb-associated kinases are proposed as potential host targets for broad-spectrum antiviral strategies. We will focus on the recent advances in Numb-associated kinases-related cellular functions and their potential as host targets for viral infections in this review. Questions that remained unknown on the cellular functions of Numb-associated kinases will also be discussed.\",\n"," 'Test-retest repeatability of ADC in prostate using the multi b-Value VERDICT acquisition.PURPOSE: VERDICT (Vascular, Extracellular, Restricted Diffusion for Cytometry in Tumours) MRI is a multi b-value, variable diffusion time DWI sequence that allows generation of ADC maps from different b-value and diffusion time combinations. The aim was to assess precision of prostate ADC measurements from varying b-value combinations using VERDICT and determine which protocol provides the most repeatable ADC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-one men (median age: 67.7\\xa0years) from a prior prospective VERDICT study (April 2016-October 2017) were analysed retrospectively. Men who were suspected of prostate cancer and scanned twice using VERDICT were included. ADC maps were formed using 5b-value combinations and the within-subject standard deviations (wSD) were calculated per ADC map. Three anatomical locations were analysed per subject: normal TZ (transition zone), normal PZ (peripheral zone), and index lesions. Repeated measures ANOVAs showed which b-value range had the lowest wSD, Spearman correlation and generalized linear model regression analysis determined whether wSD was related to ADC magnitude and ROI size. RESULTS: The mean lesion ADC for b(0)b(1500) had the lowest wSD in most zones (0.18-0.58x10(-4) mm(2)/s). The wSD was unaffected by ADC magnitude (Lesion: p\\xa0=\\xa00.064, TZ: p\\xa0=\\xa00.368, PZ: p\\xa0=\\xa00.072) and lesion Likert score (p\\xa0=\\xa00.95). wSD showed a decrease with ROI size pooled over zones (p\\xa0=\\xa00.019, adjusted regression coefficient\\xa0=\\xa0-1.6x10(-3), larger ROIs for TZ versus PZ versus lesions). ADC maps formed with a maximum b-value of 500\\xa0s/mm(2) had the largest wSDs (1.90-10.24x10(-4) mm(2)/s). CONCLUSION: ADC maps generated from b(0)b(1500) have better repeatability in normal TZ, normal PZ, and index lesions.',\n"," 'Effective drug combinations of betulinic acid and ceranib-2 loaded Zn:MnO(2) doped-polymeric nanocarriers against PC-3 prostate cancer cells.The development of theranostic nanocarriers with synergistic drug combinations has received considerable attention due to their improved pharmaceutical activity. Herein, we reported an investigation about the in-vitro anticancer activity of ceranib-2 (Cer), betulinic acid (BA), and the combination of betulinic acid and ceranib-2 (BA-Cer) against PC-3 prostate cancer cells. For this purpose, first we designed a suitable nanocarrier using a novel Zn:MnO(2) nanocomposite (NCs) and gallic acid (GA)-polylactic acid (PLA)-Alginate polymeric shell with nanoscale particle size and good stability. Chemical statements, morphology, and physicochemical properties of the nanocarrier have been illuminated with advanced characterization techniques. According to the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results, Zn:MnO(2) NCs had a spherical and monodispersed morphology with a 2.03\\xa0±\\xa00.67\\xa0nm diameter. Moreover, vibrating-sample magnetometer (VSM) results showed that Zn:MnO(2) had paramagnetic properties with a saturation magnetization (Ms) value of 1.136\\xa0emu/g. Additionally, the in-vitro cytotoxic effects of the single and binary drugs loaded Zn:MnO(2)-doped polymeric nanocarriers against PC-3 prostate cancer cells were investigated. According to the results, there was no significant cytotoxic effect of free BA and Cer against PC-3 prostate cancer cells. However, BA/Zn:MnO(2)@GA-PLA-Alginate NCs, BA-Cer/Zn:MnO(2) @GA-PLA-Alginate NCs and free BA-Cer had IC(50) values of 6.498, 7.351, and 18.571\\xa0μg/mL, respectively. Consequently, BA-Cer/Zn:MnO(2)@GA-PLA-Alginate is a nanocarrier with good stability, enhanced drug loading and release capacity for hydrophobic drugs, as well as being used as both imaging and treatment agent due to its magnetic properties. Furthermore, BA and Cer drug combination showed great promise in prostate cancer therapy which is known to be resulted high drug resistance. We strongly believed that this work could lead to an investigation of the molecular mechanisms of BA-mediated cancer theapy.',\n"," 'A semi-automated software program to assess the impact of second reads in prostate MRI for equivocal lesions: results from a UK tertiary referral centre.PURPOSE: To investigate the utility of a prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) second read using a semi-automated software program in the one-stop clinic, where patients undergo multiparametric MRI, review and biopsy planning in one visit. We looked at concordance between readers for patients with equivocal scans and the possibility for biopsy deferral in this group. METHODS: We present data from 664 consecutive patients. Scans were reported by seven different expert genitourinary radiologists using dedicated software (MIM®) and a Likert scale. All scans were rescored by another expert genitourinary radiologist using a customised workflow for second reads that includes annotated biopsy contours for accurate visual targeting. The number of scans in which a biopsy could have been deferred using biopsy results and prostate specific antigen density was assessed. Gleason score\\xa0≥\\xa03\\xa0+\\xa04 was considered clinically significant disease. Concordance between first and second reads for equivocal scans (Likert 3) was evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 209/664 (31%) patients scored Likert 3 on first read, 128 of which (61%) were concordant after second read. 103/209 (49%) of patients with Likert 3 scans were biopsied, with clinically significant disease in 31 (30%) cases. Considering Likert 3 scans that were both downgraded and biopsied using the workflow-generated biopsy contours, 25/103 (24%) biopsies could have been deferred. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing a semi-automated workflow for accurate lesion contouring and targeting biopsies is helpful during the one-stop clinic. We observed a reduction of indeterminate scans after second reading and almost a quarter of biopsies could have been deferred, reducing the potential biopsy-related side effects.',\n"," 'Comprehensive evaluation of surrogate endpoints to predict overall survival in trials with PD1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors plus chemotherapy.BACKGROUND: PD1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have revolutionized cancer treatment. Although there is controversy about the accuracy of surrogate endpoints in the ICI setting to predict overall survival (OS), these endpoints are commonly used in confirmatory trials. Here we aimed to explore the validity of classical and novel surrogate endpoints in randomised controlled trials (RCT) that combine ICI plus chemotherapy (CT) in the first-line setting. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to identify RCT investigating anti-PD1/PD-L1 drugs plus CT versus CT alone. We performed (i) arm-level analysis to evaluate predictors of median OS (mOS) and (ii) comparison-level analysis for OS hazard ratio (HR) estimations. Linear regression models weighted by trial size were fitted and adjusted R(2) values were reported. RESULTS: Thirty-nine RCTs involving 22,341 patients met the inclusion criteria (17 non-small cell lung, 9 gastroesophageal and 13 in other cancers) with ten different ICI under study. Overall, ICI plus CT improved OS (HR\\xa0=\\xa00.76; 95%CI: 0.73-0.80). In the arm-level analysis, the best mOS prediction was obtained with a new endpoint that combines median duration of response and ORR (mDoR-ORR) and with median PFS (R(2)\\xa0=\\xa00.5 both). In the comparison-level analysis, PFS HR showed a moderate association with OS HR (R(2)\\xa0=\\xa00.52). Early OS read-outs were highly associated with final OS outcomes (R(2)\\xa0=\\xa00.80). CONCLUSIONS: The association between surrogate endpoints and OS in first-line RCT combining anti-PD1/PD-L1 and CT is moderate-low. Early OS read-outs showed a good association with final OS HR while the mDOR-ORR endpoint could help to better design confirmatory trials after single-arm phase II trials.',\n"," 'MFA-Net: Multiple Feature Association Network for medical image segmentation.Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in computer-aided diagnosis. However, due to the large variability of medical images, accurate segmentation is a highly challenging task. In this paper, we present a novel medical image segmentation network named the Multiple Feature Association Network (MFA-Net), which is based on deep learning techniques. The MFA-Net utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections as its backbone network, and a parallelly dilated convolutions arrangement (PDCA) module is integrated between the encoder and the decoder to capture more representative deep features. Furthermore, a multi-scale feature restructuring module (MFRM) is introduced to restructure and fuse the deep features of the encoder. To enhance global attention perception, the proposed global attention stacking (GAS) modules are cascaded on the decoder. The proposed MFA-Net leverages novel global attention mechanisms to improve the segmentation performance at different feature scales. We evaluated our MFA-Net on four segmentation tasks, including lesions in intestinal polyp, liver tumor, prostate cancer, and skin lesion. Our experimental results and ablation study demonstrate that the proposed MFA-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of global positioning and local edge recognition.',\n"," 'Acute and late toxicity patterns of moderate hypo-fractionated radiotherapy for prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.INTRODUCTION: Moderate hypofractionated (HF) radiotherapy is becoming the new standard in radiotherapy for prostate cancer patients. It is established as safe, but it might be associated with increased acute toxicity levels. We conducted a systematic review on moderate HF to establish acute toxicity levels and their required clinical management; late toxicity was reported as a secondary outcome. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review for studies published until June 2022. We identified 17 prospective studies, with 7796 localised prostate cancer patients, reporting acute toxicity of moderate hypofractionation (2.5-3.4\\xa0Gy/fraction). A meta-analysis was done for 10/17 studies with a control arm (standard fractionation (SF)), including evaluation of late toxicity rates. We used Cochrane bias assessment and Newcastle-Ottawa bias assessment tools for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) RCT and non-RCTs, respectively. RESULTS: Pooled results showed that acute grade\\xa0≥\\xa02 gastro-intestinal (GI) toxicity was increased by 6.3\\xa0% (95\\xa0% CI for risk difference\\xa0=\\xa02.0\\xa0%-10.6\\xa0%) for HF vs SF. Acute grade\\xa0≥\\xa02 Genito-urinary (GU) and late toxicity were not significantly increased. The overall risk of bias assessment revealed a low risk in the meta-analysis of included studies. Data on management of toxicity (medication, interventions) was only reported in 2/17 studies. CONCLUSION: HF is associated with increased acute GI symptoms, needing adequate monitoring and management. Reports on toxicity management were very limited. Pooled late GI and GU toxicity showed similar levels for SF and HF.',\n"," 'Clinical Impact of a Rapid Genetic Testing Model for Advanced Prostate Cancer Patients.PURPOSE: Genetic testing may alter clinical management for individuals with metastatic prostate cancer by identifying additional therapies. Traditional counseling models are unlikely to enable time-sensitive therapeutic decision-making. This study aimed to determine the feasibility and clinical impact of an alternative hereditary genetic testing model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: As part of a multicenter, single-arm prospective trial, individuals with advanced prostate cancer were referred by their oncologist for testing of 14 genes associated with hereditary prostate cancer. Pretest education (brochure and video) was provided in the oncology clinic. Questionnaires assessing participant satisfaction with both pretest education and decision to undergo genetic testing were collected. A genetic counselor contacted participants by phone to obtain family history and discuss results. Medical records were queried to determine whether a change in clinical management was discussed. RESULTS: Of 501 participants consented to germline analysis, 51 (10.2%) had at least 1 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant. Change in treatment was discussed with 22/48 (45.8%) of eligible participants who tested positive. Feasibility of this model was assessed by participant satisfaction and turnaround time. Average±SD satisfaction with the pretest education (15.5±2.2, 4-20 scale) and with the decision to undergo genetic testing (17.1±2.9, 4-20 scale) were both high. Results were returned 20 days (median) after sample collection. CONCLUSIONS: Oncologist-initiated germline genetic testing in collaboration with a genetic counselor is a feasible approach to testing advanced prostate cancer patients with impactful clinical actionability. The testing model and educational material serve as resources to clinicians treating prostate cancer patients.',\n"," 'Randomized phase II trial in prostate cancer with hormone-sensitive OligometaSTatic relapse: Combining stereotactic ablative radiotherapy and durvalumab (POSTCARD GETUG P13): Study protocol.BACKGROUND: As in other solid tumors, increasing evidence indicates that patients diagnosed with a limited number of prostate cancer metastases, so-called oligometastases, have a better prognosis than patients with extensive metastatic disease. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is now considered an option in this population.Programmed death-1 (PD-1) and its ligands (PD-L1) are targeted by immune checkpoint inhibitors. Preclinical studies have shown that the tumor immune microenvironment changes when combining radiotherapy with immunotherapy, especially with hypofractionated radiotherapy.The oligometastatic setting appears to be the most relevant clinical situation for evaluating the immune response generated by radiotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with an intact immune system.We hypothesize that durvalumab will enhance the immune response following SBRT targeting oligometastatic lesions. Our purpose is to demonstrate, via a randomized 2:1 phase II trial, that SBRT (3 fractions) with durvalumab in oligometastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer patients would improve progression-free survival in patients with prostate cancer with up to 5 metastases compared to patients who exclusively received SBRT. METHODS: This is a multicentric randomized phase II study in French academic hospitals. Patients with prostate cancer and up to 5 metastases (lymph node and/or bone) were randomized into a 2:1 ratio between Arm A (experimental group), corresponding to durvalumab and SBRT to the metastases, and Arm B (control group), corresponding to SBRT alone to the metastases. The study aims to accrue a total of 96 patients within 3\\xa0years. The primary endpoint is two-year progression-free survival and secondary endpoints include androgen deprivation therapy-free survival, quality of life, toxicity, prostate cancer specific survival, overall survival, and immune response. DISCUSSION: The expected benefit for the patients in the experimental arm is longer life expectancy with acceptable toxicity. We also expect our study to provide data for better understanding the synergy between immunotherapy and radiotherapy in oligometastatic prostate cancer.',\n"," 'T1 mapping of the prostate using Single-Shot T1FLASH and MOLLI MRI Techniques: Comparison of artifact burden and image quality.PURPOSE: To assess artifact burden and image quality of different MRI T1 mapping techniques of the prostate. METHODS: Participants with suspected prostate cancer (PCa) were prospectively enrolled from June-October 2022 and examined with multiparametric prostate MRI (mpMRI; 3\\xa0T scanner; T1wi, T2wi, DWI und DCE). T1 mapping was performed before and after administration of gadolinium-based contrast-agent (GBCA) using (i) a modified Look-Locker inversion (MOLLI) technique and (ii) a novel single-shot T1FLASH inversion recovery technique. T2wi, DWI, T1FLASH and MOLLI sequences were systematically examined regarding prevalence of artifacts and image quality using a 5-point Likert-Scale. RESULTS: A total of n\\xa0=\\xa0100 patients were included (median age: 68\\xa0years). T1FLASH maps (pre-and post-GBCA) showed metal artifacts in 7% of cases and susceptibility artifacts in 1%. For MOLLI maps, pre-GBCA metal and susceptibility artifacts were documented in 6.5% of cases each. MOLLI maps post-GBCA showed artifacts in 59% of cases resulting primarily from urinary GBCA excretion and GBCA accumulation at the bladder base (p\\xa0<\\xa00.01 versus T1FLASH post-GBCA). Image quality for T1FLASH pre-GBCA was rated at a mean 4.9+/-0.4 and for MOLLI at 4.8+/-0.6 (p\\xa0=\\xa00.14). Post-GBCA image quality was rated at a mean 4.9+/-0.4 for T1FLASH and at 3.7+/-1.1 for MOLLI (p\\xa0<\\xa00.001). CONCLUSIONS: T1FLASH maps provide a fast and robust method for quantification of T1 relaxation times of the prostate. T1FLASH is suitable for T1 mapping of the prostate following administration of contrast agents, while MOLLI T1 mapping is impaired through GBCA accumulation at the bladder base leading to severe image artifacts and reduced image quality.',\n"," 'Clinical value of minimum apparent diffusion coefficient for prediction of clinically significant prostate cancer in the transition zone.BACKGROUND: This study investigated the association between apparent diffusion coefficients in Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System 4/5 lesions and clinically significant prostate cancer in the transition zone. METHODS: We included 102 patients who underwent transperineal cognitive fusion targeted biopsy for Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System 4/5 lesions in the transition zone between 2016 and 2020. The association between apparent diffusion coefficients and prostate cancers in the transition zone was analyzed. RESULTS: The detection rate of prostate cancer was 49% (50/102), including clinically significant prostate cancer in 37.3% (38/102) of patients. The minimum apparent diffusion coefficients in patients with clinically significant prostate cancer were 494.5\\u2009±\\u2009133.6 µm(2)/s, which was significantly lower than 653.8\\u2009±\\u2009172.5 µm(2)/s in patients with benign histology or clinically insignificant prostate cancer. Age, prostate volume, transition zone volume, and mean and minimum apparent diffusion coefficients were associated with clinically significant prostate cancer. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that only the minimum apparent diffusion coefficient value (odds ratio: 0.994; p\\u2009<\\u20090.001) was an independent predictor of clinically significant prostate cancer. When the cutoff value of the minimum apparent diffusion coefficient was less than 595\\xa0µm(2)/s, indicating the presence of prostate cancer in the transition zone, the detection rate increased to 59.2% (29/49) in this cohort. CONCLUSION: The minimum apparent diffusion coefficient provided additional value to indicate the presence of clinically significant prostate cancer in the transition zone. It may help consider the need for subsequent biopsies in patients with Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System 4/5 lesions and an initial negative targeted

interacting protein 1 facilitated proliferation and invasion of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cells.A GTPase binding protein, Ras interacting protein 1 (RASIP1), has been reported with a tumor-promoting role in lung cancer cells, and its role in lymphoma remains unknown. The analysis of medical databank shows that RASIP1 is upregulated in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) specimens. In this article, we demonstrated that RASIP1 is highly expressed in DLBCL cell lines, compared with primary B cells. The gain- and loss-of-function experiments were performed to investigate the effects of RASIP1 on DLBCL cells. CCK-8, flow cytometry, western blot, and transwell assays demonstrated that silence of RASIP1 inhibited proliferation, cell cycle transition, and invasion and induced significant apoptosis in DLBCL cells, and ectopic expression of RASIP1 played opposite roles. Xenograft results revealed that RASIP1 facilitated the growth of DLBCL cells in vivo. These findings suggest that RASIP1 may be required for malignancy of DLBCL cells. In addition, we also found that the expression of RASIP1 was negatively regulated by forkhead box O3 (FOXO3), which has been reported to suppress the proliferation of DLBCL cells. Our results indicate that FOXO3 is bound to the promoter sequence of RASIP1 and inhibits its transcription. The suppressive effects of FOXO3 on proliferation and invasion of DLBCL cells were neutralized by RASIP1. In conclusion, we demonstrate that FOXO3 negatively regulated RASIP1 facilitates growth and invasion of DLBCL cells, provides novel diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for DLBCL in clinic.',\n","       \"Public health impact of recombinant zoster vaccine for prevention of herpes zoster in US adults immunocompromised due to cancer.Individuals who are immunocompromised (IC) due to therapy or underlying disease are at increased risk of herpes zoster (HZ). This study evaluates the public health impact of recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) relative to no HZ vaccination for the prevention of HZ among adults aged ≥18\\u2009years diagnosed with selected cancers in the United States (US). A static Markov model was used to simulate three cohorts of individuals who are IC with cancer (time horizon of 30\\u2009years; one-year cycle length): hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients, patients with breast cancer (BC; a solid tumor example), and patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL; a hematological malignancy example). Cohort sizes reflect the estimated annual incidence of each condition in the US population (19,671 HSCT recipients, 279,100 patients with BC, and 8,480 patients with HL). Vaccination with RZV resulted in 2,297; 38,068; and 848 fewer HZ cases for HSCT recipients, patients with BC, and patients with HL, respectively (each versus no vaccine). Vaccination with RZV also resulted in 422; 3,184; and 93 fewer postherpetic neuralgia cases for HSCT, BC, and HL, respectively. Analyses estimated the quality-adjusted life years gained to be 109, 506, and 17 for HSCT, BC, and HL, respectively. To prevent one HZ case, the number needed to vaccinate was 9, 8, and 10, for HSCT, BC, and HL, respectively. These results suggest RZV vaccination may be an effective option to significantly reduce HZ disease burden among patients diagnosed with selected cancers in the US.\",\n","       'Nimesulide, a COX-2 inhibitor, sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by promoting DR5 clustering †.Nimesulide is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and a COX-2 inhibitor with antitumor and antiproliferative activities that induces apoptosis in oral, esophagus, breast, and pancreatic cancer cells. Despite being removed from the market due to hepatotoxicity, nimesulide is still an important research tool being used to develop new anticancer drugs. Multiple studies have been done to modify the nimesulide skeleton to develop more potent anticancer agents and related compounds are promising scaffolds for future development. As such, establishing a mechanism of action for nimesulide remains an important part of realizing its potential. Here, we show that nimesulide enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis in resistant pancreatic cancer cells by promoting clustering of DR5 in the plasma membrane. In this way, nimesulide acts like a related compound, DuP-697, which sensitizes TRAIL-resistant colon cancer cells in a similar manner. Our approach applies a time-resolved FRET-based biosensor that monitors DR5 clustering and conformational states in the plasma membrane. We show that this tool can be used for future high-throughput screens to identify novel, nontoxic small molecule scaffolds to overcome TRAIL resistance in cancer cells.',\n","       'Chinese medicinal herbs for reducing endocrine therapy-induced side effects in patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.CONTEXT: Chinese medicinal herbs (CMH) have been considered a potentially efficacious approach for patients with breast cancer that experience adverse effects from endocrine treatment. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of CMH on endocrine therapy-induced side effects in patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer. METHODS: Ten databases (e.g., PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Information Database and other databases) were searched up to 20 May 2022. The search terms included Chinese herb, breast cancer, endocrine therapy, clinical trial and their mesh terms. The study selection and data extraction were performed by two independent reviewers. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias method. RESULTS: A total of 31 studies with 2288 patients were included. There were significant improvements in bone mineral density (BMD) [lumbar BMD (MD 0.08, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.09, p\\u2009<\\u20090.00001) and femoral neck BMD (MD 0.08, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.10, p\\u2009<\\u20090.00001)] and bone gal protein (BGP) (MD 0.24, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.31, p\\u2009<\\u20090.00001), with a significant reduction in triglycerides (MD -0.53, 95% CI -1.00 to -0.07, p\\u2009<\\u20090.05) and no effect on estradiol levels (MD 0.90, 95% CI -0.31 to 2.12, p\\u2009=\\u20090.15). CONCLUSIONS: CMH combined with complementary therapy can moderately reduce endocrine therapy-induced side effects, including bone loss and dyslipidemia in patients with HR\\u2009+\\u2009breast cancer, revealing the potential role of CMH in treating (HR+) breast cancer.

Herein, new TAK-285 derivatives (9a-h) were synthesised, characterised, and biologically evaluated as dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitors. Compound 9f exhibited IC(50) values of 2.3\\u2009nM over EGFR and 234\\u2009nM over HER2, which is 38-fold of staurosporine and 10-fold of TAK-285 over EGFR. Compound 9f also showed high selectivity profile when tested over a small kinase panel. Compounds 9a-h showed IC(50) values in the range of 1.0-7.3\\u2009nM and 0.8-2.8\\u2009nM against PC3 and 22RV1 prostate carcinoma cell lines, respectively.

Among the tested compounds, 6i exhibited the most potent anti-proliferative activity towards NSCLC, CNS, Ovarian, Prostate, Colon, Melanoma, Breast, and Renal cancers with good to weak cytostatic activity and non-lethal actions. 6i demonstrated higher selectivity for cancer than normal cells. 6i could significantly increase the accumulation of S-phase cells during the cell cycle distribution of cancer cells with high potency in the induction of apoptosis. The results unveiled that 6i probably acts through dual inhibition of DHFR and TS enzymes (IC(50) = 2.41 and 8.88\\u2009µM, correspondingly). Docking studies of 6i displayed that N1-p-bromophenyl and C3-Methyl groups participate in substantial hydrophobic interactions. The drug-likeness features inferred that 6i met the acceptance criteria of Pfizer. Taking together, 6i could be a promising prototype for further optimization as an effective anticancer drug.',\n","       'The association between breast cancer and consumption of dairy products: a systematic review.BACKGROUND: Among the world, the most frequently discovered and fatal cancer in women is breast cancer (BC). From the perspective of public health, estimating the BC risk linked to dairy intake may aid in comprehensive management. In epidemiological research data on the association between eating dairy foods and the risk of BC are conflicting. Therefore, we sought to assess the link between dairy food consumption and the development of BC. MAIN TEXT: To summarize and quantify the most recent findings on consuming milk or other dairy foods and the development of BC, we performed a systematic literature review. We checked through several databases for relevant publications published in English up to January 2022. Of the 82 articles identified, only 18 met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Nine Prospective, seven Retrospective and two Cross-Sectional studies were finally identified. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, dairy consumption was inversely associated with the risk of developing breast cancer. Future studies will help elucidate the role of dairy products in human health, and their use within a balanced diet should be considered.KEY MESSAGESThe effect of different types of dairy products, and possible dose-response relationships on BC risk remains unknown.Estimating BC risk associated with dairy consumption may help to take the decision-making of physicians and public health policy in developing preventive strategies to reduce its occurrence.This systematic review was conducted to assess dairy consumption and BC risk.Overall, inverse associations were found when looking at dairy consumption and BC risk.',\n","       'Triple targeting of mutant EGFR(L858R/T790M), COX-2, and 15-LOX: design and synthesis of novel quinazolinone tethered phenyl urea derivatives for anti-inflammatory and anticancer evaluation.We designed and synthesised novel quinazolinone tethered phenyl urea derivatives (6a-p) that triple target the double mutant EGFR(L858R/T790M), COX-2, and 15-LOX. Compounds (6e, 6d, 6j, 6m, and 6n) not only had low micromolar IC50 inhibitory activities against the three targets, but they also showed good selectivity for COX-2 over COX-1 and for EGFR(L858R/T790M) over wild-type EGFR. Except for 6e and 6n, all of the tested compounds inhibited the NO production significantly more potently than celecoxib, diclofenac, and indomethacin. Compounds 6i and 6k reduced ROS levels more effectively than celecoxib and diclofenac. In terms of inhibiting TNF-α production, 6o-treated cells showed TNF-α level, which is ∼10 times lower than celecoxib. Furthermore, 6e and 6j had the highest anticancer activity against the breast cancer cell line BT-459 with growth inhibition percentages of 67.14 and 70.07%, respectively. Docking studies confirm their favoured binding affinity. The proposed compounds could be promising multi-targeted leads.',\n","       \"Pregnancy and neonatal outcomes following malignancy in pregnancy at a tertiary care Canadian center: a retrospective chart review.Objective: Data on pregnancy-associated cancers (PACs) are lacking. The objectives of this study were to determine the incidence of PACs and describe the characteristics and outcomes of pregnancies affected by malignancy at a single tertiary care center in Ottawa, Canada.Methods: This was a retrospective chart review of individuals with PAC at The Ottawa Hospital (TOH) between 2011-2022. Eligible cases were identified from the TOH Data Warehouse, the TOH instance of the Better Outcomes Registry & Network Ontario, and the TOH Division of Maternal Fetal Medicine's Perinates database. Chart reviews were conducted to confirm case eligibility and to extract demographic, oncologic, obstetrical, and neonatal measures. The annual incidence of PAC over the 11-year period was reported per 1000 deliveries. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the sample, including frequency (n) and proportions (%) for categorical variables and mean and standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables.Results: The final cohort included 59 individuals with PAC at TOH between 2011-2022. The annual incidence of PAC ranged from 0.47 to 1.54 per 1000 deliveries. The most common PACs were breast cancer (28.8%), Hodgkin lymphoma (10.2%), and thyroid cancer (8.5%). Common interventions during pregnancy included chemotherapy (33.9%) and surgical intervention (32.2%). A total of 19 individuals (32.2%) did not undergo PAC-related treatment during pregnancy. There were 55 livebirths (91.7%), 2 spontaneous abortions (3.3%), 3 induced abortions (5.0%), and no stillbirths. Among livebirths, the mean gestational age was 37.4\\u2009±\\u20092.8\\u2009weeks and the mean birthweight was 2920.3\\u2009±\\u2009650.0\\u2009g.

METHOD: A comprehensive search of four electronic databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure, PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library) was performed to identify eligible comparative studies as of April 2022. Parameters, including perioperative results and oncological and functional outcomes, were evaluated. RESULTS: Seven articles with 7575 patients undergoing RARP were included in this study. Patients with prostate cancer were grouped by age ≥ 75\\u2009years versus < 75\\u2009years. Our results demonstrated that compared with the older group, the younger group had better potency (p\\u2009<\\u2009.00001). However, there were no significant differences in operation time (p\\u2009=\\u2009.29), estimated blood loss (p\\u2009=\\u2009.13), length of hospital stay (p\\u2009=\\u2009.48), complications (p\\u2009=\\u2009.22), continence (p\\u2009=\\u2009.21), positive surgical margin (p\\u2009=\\u2009.28), and biochemical recurrence (p\\u2009=\\u2009.74) between the groups.

Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a natural antioxidant component, can effectively reduce the cardiotoxicity of DOX. Meanwhile, EGCG can inhibit the expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and reverse the MDR of tumor cells. In this study, DOX is connected with low molecular weight polyethyleneimine (PEI) via hydrazone bond to get the pH-sensitive PEI-DOX, which is then combined with EGCG to prevent the cardiotoxicity of DOX and reverse the MDR of cancer cells. In addition, folic acid (FA) modified polyethylene glycol (PEG) (PEG-FA) is added to get the targeted system PEI-DOX/EGCG/FA. The MDR reversal and targeting ability of PEI-DOX/EGCG/FA is performed by cytotoxicity and in vivo anti-tumor activity on multidrug resistant MCF-7 cells (MCF-7/ADR). Additionally, we investigate the anti-drug resistant mechanism by Western Blot. The ability of EGCG to reduce DOX cardiotoxicity is confirmed by cardiotoxicity assay. In conclusion, PEI-DOX/EGCG/FA can inhibit the expression of P-gp and reverse the MDR in tumor cells. It also shows the ability of remove oxygen free radicals effectively to prevent the cardiotoxicity of DOX.',\n","       \"PEG-conjugated bovine haemoglobin enhances efficiency of chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin with alleviating DOX-induced splenocardiac toxicity in the breast cancer.Doxorubicin (DOX) is an effective chemotherapeutic agent widely used for cancer treatment. However, hypoxia in tumour tissue and obvious adverse effects particularly cardiotoxicity restricts the clinical usage of DOX. Our study is based on the co-administration of haemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) and DOX in a breast cancer model to investigate HBOCs' ability to enhance chemotherapeutic effectiveness and its capabilities to alleviate the side effects induced by DOX. In an in-vitro study, the results suggested the cytotoxicity of DOX was significantly improved when combined with HBOCs in a hypoxic environment, and produced more γ-H2AX indicating higher DNA damage than free DOX did. Compared with administration of free DOX, combined therapy exhibited a stronger tumour suppressive effect in an in-vivo study. Further mechanism studies showed that the expression of various proteins such as hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), CD31, CD34, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in tumour tissues was also significantly reduced in the combined treatment group. In addition, HBOCs can significantly reduce the splenocardiac toxicity induced by DOX, according to the results of the haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and histological investigation. This study suggested that PEG-conjugated bovine haemoglobin may not only reduce the hypoxia in tumours and increase the efficiency of chemotherapeutic agent DOX, but also alleviate the irreversible heart toxicity caused by DOX-inducted splenocardiac dysregulation.\",\n","       'The dual-crosslinked prospective values of RAI14 for the diagnosis and chemosurveillance in triple negative breast cancer.OBJECTIVE: The exploration of non-invasive biomarkers for assessing tumor response is critical to optimize treatment decisions. In this study, we aimed at determining the potential role of RAI14 in the early diagnosis and evaluation of chemotherapy efficacy in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). METHODS: We recruited 116 patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer, 30 patients with benign breast disease and 30 healthy controls. In addition, 57 TNBC patients were collected in serum at different time points (C0, C2 and C4) for chemotherapy monitoring. The expression of serum RAI14 and CA15-3 were quantified by Elisa and electrochemiluminescence assay, respectively. Then we compared the performances of markers with the chemotherapy efficacy assessed by imaging. RESULTS: RAI14 is significantly overexpressed in TNBC and is linked to adverse clinicopathological features such as tumor burden, CA15-3 levels and the ER, PR, and HER2 status of the patients. ROC curve analysis showed that RAI14 improves the diagnostic performance for CA15-3(AUC(RAI14) = 0.934 vs. AUC(CA15-3) = 0.836), especially embodied in early-stage breast cancer diagnosis and patients with CA15-3 negativity. Furthermore, RAI14 behaves well in reproducing treatment response which was consistent with clinical Imaging assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Recent studies showed that RAI14 has a complementary effect to CA15-3 and a test combining the two parameters can improve the detection rate of early triple-negative breast cancer. At the same time, RAI14 plays a more important role in chemotherapy monitoring than CA15-3 as the change in its concentration is in line with the tumor volume variation. Taken together, RAI14 is a reliable novel marker in the early diagnosis and chemotherapy monitoring of triple-negative breast cancer.',\n","       'Bioinformatic analysis of the clinicopathological and prognostic significance of oocyte-arresting BTG4 mRNA expression in gynecological cancers.BTG4 arrests the cell cycle and suppresses oocyte and embryonic development. We performed a bioinformatic analysis of BTG4 expression. BTG4 expression was downregulated in breast cancer compared with normal tissues (p\\u2009<\\u2009.05), but the opposite was observed in cervical, endometrial and ovarian cancers (p\\u2009<\\u2009.05). BTG4 methylation was negatively correlated with its mRNA expression in breast, cervical and endometrial cancers (p\\u2009<\\u2009.05). BTG4 mRNA expression was negatively correlated with T staging and distant metastasis of breast cancer; and with tumor invasion, clinical stage, low weight and BMI, low histological grade and no diabetes in endometrial cancer but positively with T stage and non-keratinizing squamous carcinoma in endometrial cancer. BTG4 expression was negatively correlated with the survival of ovarian cancer patients (p\\u2009<\\u2009.05), but positively for breast, cervical and endometrial cancers (p\\u2009<\\u2009.05). BTG4 expression is thus a potential marker reflecting the carcinogenesis, aggressiveness and prognosis in gynecological cancers.Impact StatementWhat is already known on this subject? Previous studies have revealed the structure and location of BTG4. BTG4 inhibit cell proliferative, promote apoptosis, induce G1 cell cycle arrest. BTG4 promotes the development of mouse embryos from cell stage 1 to 2. The methylation and biological function of BTG4 were clarified in gastric and/or colorectal cancer cells.What do the results of this study add? BTG4 is found to closely link to reflect the carcinogenesis, histogenesis, aggressive behaviors and prognosis of gynecological cancers, and involved in ligand-receptor interaction, microtubule motor activity, dynein light chain binding, cilium organization, assembly, and movement in endometrial and ovarian cancers.What are the implications of these finding for clinical practice and/or further research? Aberrant BTG4 mRNA expression can be employed as a marker of the tumorigenesis, histogenesis, aggressiveness and prognosis of gynecological cancers in the future practice and guide the investigation of BTG4-related signal pathways.',\n","       'Polysialic acid-functionalized liposomes for efficient honokiol delivery to inhibit breast cancer growth and metastasis.To improve the anti-metastasis effects of honokiol (HNK) on breast cancer, we designed cationic liposomes (Lip) in which HNK was encapsulated into Lip, and its surface was modified with negatively charged polysialic acid (PSA-Lip-HNK) for efficient treatment of breast cancer. PSA-Lip-HNK possessed a homogeneous spherical shape and high encapsulation efficiency. In vitro 4T1 cell experiments indicated that PSA-Lip-HNK increased cellular uptake and cytotoxicity via the endocytosis pathway mediated by PSA and selectin receptors. Furthermore, the significant antitumor metastasis impact of PSA-Lip-HNK was confirmed by wound healing and cell migration and invasion. Enhanced in vivo tumor accumulation of the PSA-Lip-HNK was observed in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice by living fluorescence imaging. For in vivo antitumor experiments using 4T1 tumor-bearing mice, PSA-Lip-HNK exhibited a higher tumor growth and metastasis inhibition compared with unmodified liposomes. Therefore, we believe that PSA-Lip-HNK well combined biocompatible PSA nano-delivery and chemotherapy, providing a promising drug delivery approach for metastatic breast cancer therapy.',\n","       'Assessment of knowledge, understanding and awareness of Chinese women clinical staff towards menopause hormone therapy: a survey study.Menopausal Hormone Therapy (MHT) is recommended for climacteric peri postmenopausal symptoms. The rate of use of MHT in China is much lower than the western regions. Therefore, a survey was conducted for the understanding and utilization of MHT among clinical staff in various hospitals of China. A total of 3216 eligible questionnaires were included for the evaluation. According to 19.2% participant opinion, MHT could relieve menopausal symptoms, whereas the majority had no knowledge of the benefits and risks of MHT. The most common concern about MHT was the risk of cancer and about 430 (13.4%) and 176 (5.5%) participants were apprehensive that MHT could increase the risk of breast and endometrial cancer, respectively. This survey demonstrated that the knowledge of clinical staff was not comprehensive and they should be educated more about the use of MHT so that this knowledge can be imbibed into the general population.Impact StatementWhat is already known on this subject?

While screening is known to decrease cancer mortality, screening participation is sparsely investigated among drug dependent women. The aim of this study was to explore experiences of breast and cervical cancer screening-including barriers and suggested interventions to promote increased participation-among women in opioid substitution treatment (OST). METHODS: Three focus group interviews were conducted at one OST clinic in Malmö, Sweden. The interviews were moderated by OST staff, assisted by a researcher. A descriptive qualitative analysis was carried out using a template analysis approach, employing a model of healthcare access to organize the description of barriers. RESULTS: The 11 participants reported several barriers to screening access, affecting the perceived need of screening and the opportunities to seek and reach screening services. Some barriers appear to be specific to women with previous or current drug use. Suggested interventions were moral and practical support, integrated/specialized delivery of screening services, and enhanced screening invitation procedures. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings provide insight to difficulties with screening compliance among women with current or previous drug use, and provide a knowledge base for quantitative and intervention studies.',\n","       'SREKA-targeted liposomes for highly metastatic breast cancer therapy.Chemotherapy is still a leading therapeutic approach in various tumor types that is often accompanied by a poor prognosis because of metastases. PEGylated liposomes with CREKA targeting moiety are well-known therapeutic agents, especially in highly metastatic experimental models. CREKA specifically targets tumor-associated ECM, which is present at the primary, as well as metastatic tumor sites. To better understand the function of the targeting moieties, we decided to design various liposome formulations with different amounts of targeting moiety attached to their DSPE-PEG molecules. Moreover, a new tumor-homing pentapeptide (SREKA) was designed, and a novel conjugation strategy between SREKA and DSPE-PEGs. First, the in vitro proliferation inhibition of drug-loaded liposomes and the cellular uptake of their cargo were investigated. Afterward, liposome stability in murine blood and drug accumulation in different tissues were measured. Furthermore, in vivo tumor growth, and metastasis inhibition potencies of the different liposome formulations were examined. According to our comparative studies, SREKA-liposomes have a uniform phenotype after formulation and have similar characteristics and tumor-homing capabilities to CREKA-liposomes. However, the exchange of the N-terminal cysteine to serine during conjugation results in a higher production yield and better stability upon conjugation to DSPE-PEGs. We also showed that SREKA-liposomes have significant inhibition on primary tumor growth and metastasis incidence; furthermore, increase the survival rate of tumor-bearing mice. Besides, we provide evidence that the amount of targeting moiety attached to DSPE-PEGs is largely responsible for the stability of liposomes, therefore it plays an important role in toxicity and targeting.',\n","       'New benzothiazole hybrids as potential VEGFR-2 inhibitors: design, synthesis, anticancer evaluation, and in silico study.A new series of 2-aminobenzothiazole hybrids linked to thiazolidine-2,4-dione 4a-e, 1,3,4-thiadiazole aryl urea 6a-d, and cyanothiouracil moieties 8a-d was synthesised. The in\\xa0vitro antitumor effect of the new hybrids was assessed against three cancer cell lines, namely, HCT-116, HEPG-2, and MCF-7 using Sorafenib (SOR) as a standard drug. Among the tested compounds, 4a was the most potent showing IC50 of 5.61, 7.92, and 3.84\\u2009µM, respectively. Furthermore, compounds 4e and 8a proved to have strong impact on breast cancer cell line with IC50 of 6.11 and 10.86\\u2009µM, respectively. The three compounds showed a good safety profile towards normal WI-38 cells. Flow cytometric analysis of the three compounds in MCF-7 cells revealed that compounds 4a and 4c inhibited cell population in the S phase, whereas 8a inhibited the population in the G1/S phase. The most promising compounds were subjected to a VEGFR-2 inhibitory assay where 4a emerged as the best active inhibitor of VEGFR-2 with IC50 91\\u2009nM, compared to 53\\u2009nM for SOR. In silico analysis showed that the three new hybrids succeeded to link to the active site like the co-crystallized inhibitor SOR.',\n","       'Potential lipid-based strategies of amphotericin B designed for oral administration in clinical application.Amphotericin B (AmB) is regarded as a first-line therapy against life-threatening invasive fungal infections. Due to its poor oral bioavailability, AmB is restricted to intravenous administration in clinical practice. As science continues to move forward, two lipid-based formulations are successfully developed for oral AmB administration, currently undergoing phase I clinical trials. Encouragingly, lipid-AmB conjugates with emulsions also exhibit a better bioavailability, which may be another strategy to design oral AmB formulation in clinical practice. Thus, this review mainly focused on the two lipid-based formulations in clinical trials, and discussed the potential perspectives of AmB-lipid conjugation-loaded nanocochleates and emulsions.',\n","       'Vasomotor symptoms and management of women undergoing treatment for\\xa0breast cancer: literature review with focus on the therapeutic potential of\\xa0cytoplasmic pollen extract.OBJECTIVE: Effective management of vasomotor symptoms (VMS) in patients undergoing treatment for breast cancer (BC) represents a critical but frequent unmet need. This review summarizes the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical features of VMS in patients with BC and provides a synopsis of the complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) approaches in relieving VMS with a focus on purified cytoplasm of pollen (PCP). METHODS: The literature on VMS epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical burden, and CAM treatment in healthy women and patients with BC was reviewed. RESULTS: VMS are common in patients with BC undergoing hormonal treatment and negatively impact quality of life, leading to treatment discontinuation in up to 25% of patients with detrimental impact on risk of BC recurrence and overall survival. CAM approaches to treat VMS in patients with BC include vitamin E, phytoestrogens, and black cohosh, even if there is a lack of solid evidence to guide clinicians in the choice of treatment. PCP, obtained according to standards of good manufacturing practice, has a definite pharmacological mechanism of action, is devoid of estrogen activity, and has shown clinical efficacy on menopause-associated symptoms with a favorable safety profile and high compliance. As such, it appears to represent a valid management option to improve quality of life in patients with pre- and postmenopausal BC. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians should actively investigate the presence and impact of VMS in patients receiving therapy for BC. Additional and appropriately sized randomized clinical trials are needed to provide clear evidence on how to best meet the needs of patients with BC suffering from menopause-associated symptoms.',\n","       \"Factors associated with poor sleep quality in midlife Singaporean women: The Integrated Women's Health program (IWHP).OBJECTIVE: To examine factors associated with poor sleep quality in community-dwelling midlife women. METHODS: Healthy women (aged 45-69 years) of Chinese, Malay and Indian ethnicities attending well-women clinics at the National University Hospital, Singapore, completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). A PQSI score >5 denoted poor sleep quality. The women filled out validated questionnaires covering menopausal and genito-urinary symptoms, and mental health. Physical performance was measured. Bone mineral density and visceral adiposity were assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Binary logistic regression analyses assessed independent factors for poor sleep. RESULTS: Poor sleep quality was reported in 38.2% of women (n\\xa0=\\xa01094, mean age: 56.4\\xa0±\\xa06.2 years). Indian women had higher sleep disturbance scores than Chinese women (mean\\xa0±\\xa0SD: 1.33\\xa0±\\xa00.58 vs 1.17\\xa0±\\xa00.49). Malays experienced more daytime dysfunction (0.54\\xa0±\\xa00.60 vs 0.33\\xa0±\\xa00.55) and had a higher overall PSQI score (6.00\\xa0±\\xa03.31 vs 5.02\\xa0±\\xa02.97) than the Chinese. A low education level (aOR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.01-3.05), feelings of irritability (2.67, 1.56-4.60) and vaginal dryness (1.62, 1.03-2.54) were associated with poor sleep quality in the adjusted multivariable model. Women with moderate to severe disability were ∼3 times (2.99, 1.20-7.44) more likely to experience less than ideal sleep quality, while urinary incontinence (1.53, 1.08-2.17) and breast cancer history (2.77, 1.36-5.64) were also associates of poor sleep quality. CONCLUSION: Self-reports of education level, irritability, vaginal dryness, disability, urinary incontinence, and breast cancer history were independently related to poor sleep. Ethnic differences suggest the need for targeted interventions among the ethnic groups.\",\n","       'Utilization of a nanostructured lipid carrier encapsulating pitavastatin-Pinus densiflora oil for enhancing cytotoxicity against the gingival carcinoma HGF-1 cell line.Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common epithelial tumor of the oral cavity. Gingival tumors, a unique type of OSCC, account for 10% of these malignant tumors. The antineoplastic properties of statins, including pitavastatin (PV), and the essential oil of the Pinus densiflora leaf (Pd oil) have been adequately reported. The goal of this investigation was to develop nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) containing PV combined with Pd oil and to determine their cytotoxicity against the cell line of human gingival fibroblasts (HGF-1). A central composite quadratic design was adopted to optimize the nanocarriers. The particle size and stability index of the nano-formulations were measured to evaluate various characteristics. TEM analysis, the entrapment efficiency, dissolution efficiency, and the cytotoxic efficiency of the optimized PV-loaded nanostructured lipid carrier drug delivery system (PV-Pd-NLCs) were evaluated. Then, the optimal PV-Pd-NLCs was incorporated into a Carbopol 940® gel base and tested for its rheological features and its properties of release and cell viability. The optimized NLCs had a particle size of 98\\u2009nm and a stability index of 89%. The gel containing optimum PV-Pd-NLCs had reasonable dissolution efficiency and acceptable rheological behavior and acquired the best cytotoxic activity against HGF-1 cell line among all the formulations developed for the study. The in vitro cell viability studies revealed a synergistic effect between PV and Pd oil in the treatment of gingival cancer. These findings illustrated that the gel containing PV-Pd-NLCs could be beneficial in the local treatment of gingival cancer.',\n","       'Effects of MFG-E8 expression on the biological characteristics of ovarian cancer cells via the AKT/mTOR/S6K signalling pathway.In this study, we assessed the effects of MFG-E8 on the biological characteristics of ovarian cancer cells and explored the underlying mechanisms. Human ovarian cancer SKOV3 cells were transfected with MFG-E8 siRNA or NC siRNA. CCK-8, cell adhesion, scratch-wound, and Transwell assays were used to detect changes in cell metastatic processes. Effects of MFG-E8 silencing on the proteins involved in AKT/mTOR/S6K signalling pathway were assessed using qRT-PCR and Western blotting. Transient silencing of MFG-E8 in SKOV3 cells decreased cell proliferation and downregulated the expression of CDK4, cyclin D1, and caspase-3 proteins. Cell adhesion, migration, and invasion were also suppressed. p-AKT, p-mTORC1, and p-p70S6K levels decreased following MFG-E8 knockdown. Hence, MFG-E8 enhances carcinogenesis and affects the AKT/mTOR/S6K signalling pathway in ovarian cancer cells. In conclusion, our results suggested that MFG-E8 could promote ovarian cancer via AKT/mTOR/S6K signalling pathway which improved our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in ovarian cancer.IMPACT STATEMENTWhat is already known on this subject? Milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor 8 (MFG-E8) is expressed in several types of cancers such as oesophageal, breast, and liver. However, the mechanism of MFG-E8 involving in EOC remains unknown. We previously found that MFG-E8 expression was related to pathological staging, tissue differentiation, platinum sensitivity, ascites state, and other clinicopathological characteristics.What the results of this study add? Due to a series of in vitro studies, we confirmed that MFG-E8 is involved in the process of proliferation, invasion and metastasis. Our results show that silencing MFG-E8 can significantly inhibit the expression of cyclin D1 and CDK4 in EOC SKOV3 cells. MFG-E8 enhances carcinogenesis and affects the AKT/mTOR/S6K signaling pathway in ovarian cancer.What the implications are of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Taken together, our findings suggest that MFG-E8 may be an oncogene in EOC and provide new insights into the mechanism of MFG-E8 in the progression of EOC.',\n","       'A key regulatory loop AK4P1/miR-375/SP1 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is one of the leading lethal human cancer types and is notorious for its poor prognosis. A series of bioinformatic analyses and experimental validations were employed to explore the role and mechanism of pseudogene-derived RNAs in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Consequently, a total of 13 upregulated and 7 downregulated pseudogene-derived RNAs in pancreatic adenocarcinoma were identified. Survival analysis revealed a statistically predictive role of AK4P1 for unfavourable prognosis of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Subcellular location analysis indicated that AK4P1 was mainly located in cytoplasm, in which AK4P1 might competitively bind to tumour suppressive miR-375 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Further analysis showed that SP1 was a potential downstream target gene of miR-375 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Intriguingly, expression determination validated that SP1 could positively regulate AK4P1 levels in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Finally, AK4P1 might also exert its effects by interacting with oncogenic parental gene AK4 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Conclusively, the present study elucidated a key regulatory loop AK4P1/miR-375/SP1 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.',\n","       'Ferric-loaded lipid nanoparticles inducing ferroptosis-like cell death for\\xa0antibacterial wound healing.Skin infection is a major health issue that usually is caused by the continuous proliferation of bacteria in wounds. With the abuse of antibiotics worldwide, the battle against skin infection is becoming more and more difficult. Therefore, the development of new ways with different antibacterial mechanisms to current antibiotics is urgently needed. Inspired by the powerful inhibition of ferroptosis used in cancer therapy, here in our study, ferric-loaded lipid nanoparticles (Fe-LNPs) with unform size (∼130\\u2009nm) and surface charge (∼12\\u2009mV) were constructed and found to effectively inhibit the growth of both Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, S. aureus) and negative (Escherichia coli, E. coli) strains, possibly due to induction of ferroptosis-like cell death mechanisms. Most importantly, Fe-LNPs can also effectively inhibit the proliferation of S. aureus in a skin infection model and promote the healing of wounds. The Fe-LNPs can be applied as a powerful antibacterial formulation for future application in clinic.',\n","       'Design, synthesis and antitumor evaluation of novel pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidines incorporating different amino acid conjugates as potential DHFR inhibitors.The present study aimed to investigate the antitumor effect of simultaneous inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) enzyme. We designed some novel pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidines bearing different amino acid conjugates as efficient antifolate agents attributable to their structural similarity with methotrexate (MTX) and MTX-related antifolates. All compounds were tested to screen their enzymatic inhibition against DHFR compared with the reference drug MTX and for their in\\xa0vitro antitumor cytotoxicity against six MTX-resistant cancer cell lines. The flow cytometry indicated that the most potent compound 7f arrested MCF-7 cells in the S-phase and induced apoptosis. Western blot for visualisation proved the ability of compound 7f to induce the expression of proapoptotic caspases and Bax proteins in MCF-7 breast cancer cell line beside its ability to diminish the expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein. Molecular modelling studies concluded that compound 7f displayed better binding energy than that of the normal ligand MTX.

Human breast cancer (MCF7), hepatocellular carcinoma (HEPG2), larynx cancer (HEP2), lung cancer (H460), colon cancers (HCT116 and Caco2), and hypopharyngeal cancer (FADU), and normal Vero cell lines were used. Compounds 8 and 14 displayed outstanding effects on the investigated cell lines and were further tested for their antioxidant activity in MCF7, H460, FADU, HEP2, HEPG2, HCT116, Caco2, and Vero cells by measuring superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde content (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), and nitric oxide (NO) content. Besides, Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection and cell cycle DNA index using the HEPG-2 cell line were established on both compounds as well.

There is an imminent need to establish validation platforms that enable fair and transparent testing of these systems against external data. APPROACH: We developed validation of artificial intelligence for breast imaging (VAI-B), a platform for independent validation of AI algorithms in breast imaging. The platform is a hybrid solution, with one part implemented in the cloud and another in an on-premises environment at Karolinska Institute. Cloud services provide the flexibility of scaling the computing power during inference time, while secure on-premises clinical data storage preserves their privacy. A MongoDB database and a python package were developed to store and manage the data on-premises. VAI-B requires four data components: radiological images, AI inferences, radiologist assessments, and cancer outcomes. RESULTS: To pilot test VAI-B, we defined a case-control population based on 8080 patients diagnosed with breast cancer and 36,339 healthy women based on the Swedish national quality registry for breast cancer. Images and radiological assessments from more than 100,000 mammography examinations were extracted from hospitals in three regions of Sweden. The images were processed by AI systems from three vendors in a virtual private cloud to produce abnormality scores related to signs of cancer in the images. A total of 105,706 examinations have been processed and stored in the database. CONCLUSIONS: We have created a platform that will allow downstream evaluation of AI systems for breast cancer detection, which enables faster development cycles for participating vendors and safer AI adoption for participating hospitals. The platform was designed to be scalable and ready to be expanded should a new vendor want to evaluate their system or should a new hospital wish to obtain an evaluation of different AI systems on their images.',\n","       'Malmö Breast ImaginG database: objectives and development.PURPOSE: We describe the design and implementation of the Malmö Breast ImaginG (M-BIG) database, which will support research projects investigating various aspects of current and future breast cancer screening programs. Specifically, M-BIG will provide clinical data to:1.investigate the effect of breast cancer screening on breast cancer prognosis and mortality;2.develop and validate the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in breast image interpretation; and3.develop and validate image-based radiological breast cancer risk profiles. APPROACH: The M-BIG database is intended to include a wide range of digital mammography (DM) and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) examinations performed on women at the Mammography Clinic in Malmö, Sweden, from the introduction of DM in 2004 through 2020.

Approved anti-breast tumor drugs exhibit several side effects and some patients develop resistance during the early treatment stage. This study aimed to use an in-silico approach to identify and design potential therapeutic agents. METHODS: Robust 3D-QSAR models were developed using quinazoline-4(3H)-one analogs as EGFR inhibitors. The best model was then selected based on statistical parameters and was subsequently used to design more potent therapeutic agents. Molecular docking simulation was executed using the data set and the designed compounds to identify lead compounds which were further screened by pharmacokinetic profiling by applying SwissADME and pkCSM software. RESULTS: Internal validations of the best CoMFA and CoMSIA models (R(2)\\xa0=\\xa00.855 and 0.895; Q(2)\\xa0=\\xa00.570 and 0.599) passed the threshold values for the establishment of a consistent QSAR model. The constructed models were further validated externally using six compounds as a test set, thus revealing a satisfactory predicted correlation coefficient (R(2) (pred)\\xa0=\\xa00.657 and 0.681). The CoMSIA_SHE models with the best statistical parameters were further subjected to applicability domain checks and only three influentials were detected. These were then utilized to design five novel compounds with activities ranging from 5.62 to 6.03. Molecular docking studies confirmed that compounds 20 to 26, with docking scores ranging from\\xa0-163.729 to\\xa0-169.796, represented lead compounds with higher docking scores compared to Gefitinib (-127.495). Furthermore, the designed compounds exhibited better docking scores ranging from\\xa0-171.379 to\\xa0-179.138. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacological studies identified compounds 20, 24 26 and the designed compounds 2, 3, 5 as feasible drug candidates.

Targeting the early stage of disease would allow dramatic improvements in the survival of cancer patients. The early stage of the disease is related to cancer cell spreading across surrounding healthy epithelium. Consequently, deeper insight into cell dynamics along the biointerface between epithelial and cancer (mesenchymal) cells is necessary in order to control the disease as soon as possible. Cell dynamics along this epithelial-cancer biointerface is the result of the interplay between various biological and physical mechanisms. Despite extensive research devoted to study cancer cell spreading across the epithelium, we still do not understand the physical mechanisms which influences the dynamics along the biointerface. These physical mechanisms are related to the interplay between physical parameters such as: (1) interfacial tension between cancer and epithelial subpopulations, (2) established interfacial tension gradients, (3) the bending rigidity of the biointerface and its impact on the interfacial tension, (4) surface tension of the subpopulations, (5) viscoelasticity caused by collective cell migration, and (6) cell residual stress accumulation. The main goal of this study is to review some of these physical parameters in the context of the epithelial/cancer biointerface elaborated on the model system such as the biointerface between breast epithelial MCF-10A cells and cancer MDA-MB-231 cells and then to incorporate these parameters into a new biophysical model that could describe the dynamics of the biointerface. We conclude by discussing three biophysical scenarios for cell dynamics along the biointerface, which can occur depending on the magnitude of the generated shear stress: a smooth biointerface, a slightly-perturbed biointerface and an intensively-perturbed biointerface in the context of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. These scenarios are related to the probability of cancer invasion.',\n","       'Engineered human pluripotent stem cell-derived natural killer cells with PD-L1 responsive immunological memory for enhanced immunotherapeutic efficacy.Adoptive chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered natural killer (NK) cells have shown promise in treating various cancers. However, limited immunological memory and access to sufficient numbers of allogenic donor cells have hindered their broader preclinical and clinical applications. Here, we first assess eight different CAR constructs that use an anti-PD-L1 nanobody and/or universal anti-fluorescein (FITC) single-chain variable fragment (scFv) to enhance antigen-specific proliferation and anti-tumor cytotoxicity of NK-92\\xa0cells against heterogenous solid tumors. We next genetically engineer human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) with optimized CARs and differentiate them into functional dual CAR-NK cells. The tumor microenvironment responsive anti-PD-L1 CAR effectively promoted hPSC-NK cell proliferation and cytotoxicity through antigen-dependent activation of phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) and pSTAT5 signaling pathways via an intracellular truncated IL-2 receptor β-chain (ΔIL-2Rβ) and STAT3-binding tyrosine-X-X-glutamine (YXXQ) motif. Anti-tumor activities of PD-L1-induced memory-like hPSC-NK cells were further boosted by administering a FITC-folate bi-specific adapter that bridges between a programmable anti-FITC CAR and folate receptor alpha-expressing breast tumor cells. Collectively, our hPSC CAR-NK engineering platform is modular and could constitute a realistic strategy to manufacture off-the-shelf CAR-NK cells with immunological memory-like phenotype for targeted immunotherapy.',\n","       'Multi-vendor robustness analysis of a commercial artificial intelligence system for breast cancer detection.PURPOSE: Population-based screening programs for the early detection of breast cancer have significantly reduced mortality in women, but they are resource intensive in terms of time, cost, and workload and still have limitations mainly due to the use of 2D imaging techniques, which may cause overlapping of tissues, and interobserver variability. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems may be a valuable tool to assist radiologist when reading and classifying mammograms based on the malignancy of the detected lesions. However, there are several factors that can influence the outcome of a mammogram and thus also the detection capability of an AI system. The aim of our work is to analyze the robustness of the diagnostic ability of an AI system designed for breast cancer detection. APPROACH: Mammograms from a population-based screening program were scored with the AI system. The sensitivity and specificity by means of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were obtained as a function of the mammography unit manufacturer, demographic characteristics, and several factors that may affect the image quality (age, breast thickness and density, compression applied, beam quality, and delivered dose). RESULTS: The area under the curve (AUC) from the scoring ROC curve was 0.92 (95% confidence interval = 0.89 - 0.95). It showed no dependence with any of the parameters considered, as the differences in the AUC for different interval values were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the AI system analyzed in our work has a robust diagnostic capability, and that its accuracy is independent of the studied parameters.',\n","       'A self-monitoring microneedle patch for light-controlled synergistic treatment of melanoma.Melanoma is the most aggressive and malignant form of skin cancer. Current melanoma treatment methods generally suffer from frequent drug administration as well as difficulty in direct monitoring of drug release. Here, a self-monitoring microneedle (MN)-based drug delivery system, which integrates a dissolving MN patch with aggregation-induced emission (AIE)-active PATC microparticles, is designed to achieve light-controlled pulsatile chemo-photothermal synergistic therapy of melanoma. The PATC polymeric particles, termed D/I@PATC, encapsulate both of chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX) and the photothermal agent indocyanine green (ICG). Upon light illumination, PATC gradually dissociates into smaller particles, causing the release of encapsulated DOX and subsequent fluorescence intensity change of PATC particles, thereby not only enabling direct observation of the drug release process under light stimuli, but also facilitating verification of drug release by fluorescence recovery after light trigger. Moreover, encapsulation of ICG in PATC particles displays significant improvement of its photothermal stability both in vitro and in vivo. In a tumor-bearing mouse, the application of one D/I@PATC MN patch combining with two cycles of light irradiation showed excellent controllable chemo-photothermal efficacy and exhibited ∼97% melanoma inhibition rate without inducing any evident systemic toxicity, suggesting a great potential for skin cancer treatment in clinics.',\n","       'An ultrasensitive label-free fluorescent aptamer sensor based on pH-gated release coumarin for detect HER2.Evaluation of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) molecular markers is a very suitable option for early diagnosis of breast cancer. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have large porosity and surface interactions such as π-π stacking, electrostatics, hydrogen bonding, and coordination. Here, we integrated the HER2 aptamer and fluorescent probe coumarin (COU) with zeolite imidazolic acid framework-8 (ZIF-8) to construct a label-free fluorescent aptamer sensor with pH-gated release of COU. In the presence of the target-HER2, the aptamer adsorbed on the surface of ZIF-8@COU specifically recognizes and falls off the HER2 protein, exposing a portion of the pore size of ZIF-8@COU while reducing the negative charge on the sensor surface, under alkaline hydrolysis conditions, a large number of COU fluorescent molecules can be produced and released in the detection system.The aptamer fluorescence sensor has good detection performance, sensitivity and low background interference, the detection linearity range of HER2 protein is 0.05-10\\xa0ng/mL, the detection limit is 0.0005\\xa0ng/mL, and it has good recovery rate for the serum detection of clinical breast cancer patients. Therefore, this sensor has high potential in detecting and monitoring HER2 levels for the care and clinical diagnosis of breast cancer patients.',\n","       'Dual probe difference specimen imaging for prostate cancer margin assessment.SIGNIFICANCE: Positive margin status due to incomplete removal of tumor tissue during radical prostatectomy for high-risk localized prostate cancer requires reoperation or adjuvant therapy, which increases morbidity and mortality. Adverse effects of prostate cancer treatments commonly include erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, and bowel dysfunction, making successful initial curative prostatectomy imperative. AIM: Current intraoperative tumor margin assessment is largely limited to frozen section analysis, which is a lengthy, labor-intensive process that is obtrusive to the clinical workflow within the operating room (OR). Therefore, a rapid method for prostate cancer margin assessment in the OR could improve outcomes for patients. APPROACH: Dual probe difference specimen imaging (DDSI), which uses paired antibody-based probes that are labeled with spectrally distinct fluorophores, was shown herein for prostate cancer margin assessment. The paired antibody-based probes consisted of a targeted probe to prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and an untargeted probe, which were used as a cocktail to stain resected murine tissue specimens including prostate tumor, adipose, muscle, and normal prostate. Ratiometric images (i.e., DDSI) of the difference between targeted and untargeted probe uptake were calculated and evaluated for accuracy using receiver operator characteristic curve analysis with area under the curve values used to evaluate the utility of the DDSI method to detect PSMA positive prostate cancer. RESULTS: Targeted and untargeted probe uptake was similar between the high and low PSMA expressing tumor due to nonspecific probe uptake after topical administration. The ratiometric DDSI approach showed substantial contrast difference between the PSMA positive tumors and their respective normal tissues (prostate, adipose, muscle). Furthermore, DDSI showed substantial contrast difference between the high PSMA expressing tumors and the minimally PSMA expressing tumors due to the ratiometric correction for the nonspecific uptake patterns in resected tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Previous work has shown that ratiometic imaging has strong predictive value for breast cancer margin status using topical administration. Translation of the ratiometric DDSI methodology herein from breast to prostate cancers demonstrates it as a robust, ratiometric technique that provides a molecularly specific imaging modality for intraoperative margin detection. Using the validated DDSI protocol on resected prostate cancers permitted rapid and accurate assessment of PSMA status as a surrogate for prostate cancer margin status. Future studies will further evaluate the utility of this technology to quantitatively characterize prostate margin status using PSMA as a biomarker.',\n","       'Enzyme-triggered deep tumor penetration of a dual-drug nanomedicine enables an enhanced cancer combination therapy.Cancer cells could be eradicated by promoting generation of excessive intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) via emerging nanomedicines. However, tumor heterogeneity and poor penetration of nanomedicines often lead to diverse levels of ROS production in the tumor site, and ROS at a low level promote tumor cell growth, thus diminishing the therapeutic effect of these nanomedicines. Herein, we construct an amphiphilic and block polymer-dendron conjugate-derived nanomedicine (Lap@pOEGMA-b-p(GFLG-Dendron-Ppa), GFLG-DP/Lap NPs) that incorporates a photosensitizer, Pyropheophorbide a (Ppa), for ROS therapy and Lapatinib (Lap) for molecular targeted therapy. Lap, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor that plays a role in inhibiting cell growth and proliferation, is hypothesized to synergize with ROS therapy for effectively killing cancer cells. Our results suggest that the enzyme-sensitive polymeric conjugate, pOEGMA-b-p(GFLG-Dendron-Ppa) (GFLG-DP), releases in response to cathepsin B (CTSB) after entering the tumor tissue. Dendritic-Ppa has a strong adsorption capacity to tumor cell membranes, which promotes efficient penetration and long-term retention. Lap can also be efficiently delivered to internal tumor cells to play its role due to the increased vesicle activity. Laser irradiation of Ppa-containing tumor cells results in production of intracellular ROS that is sufficient for inducing cell apoptosis. Meanwhile, Lap efficiently inhibits proliferation of remaining viable cells even in deep tumor regions, thus generating a significant synergistic anti-tumor therapeutic effect. This novel strategy can be extended to the development of efficient membrane lipid-based therapies to effectively combat tumors.',\n","       'Jaboticaba (Myrciaria jaboticaba) peel extracts induce reticulum stress and apoptosis in breast cancer cells.Jaboticaba peel (Myrciaria jaboticaba) is a source of bioactive compounds. We investigated the anticancer activity of ethyl acetate extract (JE1) and hydroethanolic extract (JE2) of Jaboticaba peel against breast cancer. Both JE1 and JE2 inhibited clonogenic potential of MDA-MB-231 cells while JE1 was particularly effective in MCF7 cells. Anchorage-independent growth and cell viability was also inhibited by JE1 and JE2. In addition to growth inhibition, JE1 and JE2 could also inhibit migration and invasion of cells. Interestingly, JE1 and JE2 show selective inhibition towards certain breast cancer cells and biological processes. Mechanistic evaluations showed that JE1 induced PARP cleavage, BAX and BIP indicating apoptotic induction. An elevation of phosphorylated ERK was observed in MCF7 cells in response to JE1 and JE2 along with increased IRE-α and CHOP expression indicating increased endoplasmic stress. Therefore, Jaboticaba peel extracts could be potentially considered for further development for breast cancer inhibition.',\n","       \"Breast cancer cell growth arrest and chemopreventive effects of Passiflora edulis Sims (Passifloraceae) ethanolic leaves extract on a rat model of mammary carcinoma.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Despite various prevention and treatment measures, the incidence and mortality due to breast cancer has been increasing globally. Passiflora edulis Sims is a plant used for the treatment of various diseases in traditional medicine, including cancers. AIM OF THE STUDY: To assess the anti-breast cancer activity of the ethanolic extract of P. edulis leaves in vitro and in vivo. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In vitro, the cell growth and proliferation were determined based on the MTT and BrdU assays. The flow cytometry was used to analyze the cell death mechanism while, cell migration, cell adhesion and chemotaxis were assayed for anti-metastatic potential. In vivo, 56 female Wistar rats aged 45-50 days (∼75\\xa0g) were exposed to 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene-DMBA except the normal group. Negative control group (DMBA) received solvent dilution throughout the study; standards groups (tamoxifen - 3.3\\xa0mg/kg BW and letrozole - 1\\xa0mg/kg BW) as well as P. edulis leaves ethanolic extract groups (50, 100 and 200\\xa0mg/kg) treated for 20 weeks. Tumor incidence, tumor burden and volume, CA 15-3 serum' level, antioxidant, inflammatory status and histopathology were assessed. RESULTS: P. edulis extract showed a significant and concentration-dependent inhibition of MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231\\xa0cells growth at 100\\xa0μg/mL. It inhibited cell proliferation and clones' formation and induced apoptosis in MDA-MB 231\\xa0cells. The migration of cell into the zone freed of cells and the number of invading cells after the 48 and 72\\xa0h were significantly diminished while, it increased their adherence to collagen and fibronectin extracellular matrix as does Doxorubicin. In vivo, all rats in the DMBA group exhibited a significant (p < 0.001) increase in tumor volume, tumor burden and grade (adenocarcinoma of SBR III) and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (TNF-α, INF-γ, IL-6 and IL-12). P. edulis extract at all tested doses significantly inhibited the DMBA-induced increase in tumor incidence, tumor burden and grade (SBR I) as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, it increased enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants (SOD, catalase, and GSH) and decreased MDA levels although a greater effect was observed with Tamoxifen and Letrozole. P. edulis has medium content on polyphenols, flavonoids and tannins. CONCLUSION: P. edulis has chemo-preventive effects against DMBA-induced breast cancer in rats probably through its antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and apoptosis-inducing potentials.\",\n","       'Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio Is Associated With the Proportion of Poorly Differentiated Components in Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma.INTRODUCTION: Diagnosis of poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (PDTC) requires ≥ 50% of poorly differentiated components (PDC) in Japan. However, the optimal cutoff percentage of PDC for PDTC diagnosis remains controversial. Although high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) correlates with the aggressiveness of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), whether NLR is associated with the proportion of PDC in PTC remains unstudied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with the pure PTC (n\\xa0=\\xa0664), PTC with < 50% PDC (n\\xa0=\\xa019), or PTC with ≥ 50% PDC (n\\xa0=\\xa026) who underwent surgery were retrospectively analyzed. Twelve-year disease-specific survival and preoperative NLR were compared among these groups. RESULTS: Twenty seven patients died from thyroid cancer. The PTC with ≥ 50% PDC group (80.7%) showed significantly worse 12-year disease-specific survival than the pure PTC group (97.2%) (P\\xa0<\\xa00.001); however, the < 50% PDC group (94.7%) did not (P\\xa0=\\xa00.91). The PTC with ≥ 50% PDC group had a significantly higher NLR than the pure PTC (P\\xa0<\\xa00.001) and the PTC with < 50% PDC groups (P\\xa0<\\xa00.001), whereas there was no significant difference in the NLR between the pure PTC and the PTC with < 50% PDC groups (P\\xa0=\\xa00.48). CONCLUSIONS: PTC with ≥ 50% PDC is more aggressive than either pure PTC or PTC with < 50% PDC, and NLR potentially reflects the PDC proportion. These results support the validity of 50% PDC as a cut-off for PDTC diagnosis and indicate the utility of NLR as a biomarker for PDC proportion.',\n","       'Co-delivery of gemcitabine and paclitaxel plus NanoCpG empowers chemoimmunotherapy of postoperative \"cold\" triple-negative breast cancer.Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) due to lack of clear target and notorious \"cold\" tumor microenvironment (TME) is one of the most intractable and lethal malignancies. Tuning \"cold\" TME into \"hot\" becomes an emerging therapeutic strategy to TNBC. Herewith, we report that integrin-targeting micellar gemcitabine and paclitaxel (ATN-mG/P, ATN sequence: Ac-PhScNK-NH(2)) cooperating with polymersomal CpG (NanoCpG) effectively \"heated up\" and treated TNBC. ATN-mG/P exhibited greatly boosted apoptotic activity in 4T1 cells, induced potent immunogenic cell death (ICD), and efficiently stimulated maturation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs). Remarkably, in a postoperative TNBC model, ATN-mG/P combining with NanoCpG promoted strong anti-cancer immune responses, showing a greatly augmented proportion of mature DCs and CD8(+) T cells while reduced immune-suppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T cells (T(reg)), which led to complete inhibition of lung metastasis and 60% mice tumor-free. The co-delivery of gemcitabine and paclitaxel at desired ratio in combination with NanoCpG provides a unique platform for potent chemoimmunotherapy of \"cold\" tumors like TNBC.',\n","       'A randomized controlled study to compare analgesic efficacy of sublingual buprenorphine and intravenous tramadol in patients undergoing mastectomy.Sublingual (SL) buprenorphine is approved for managing acute postoperative pain, characterized by easy administration, good pain relief and good patient compliance. We hypothesized that SL buprenorphine would be a better perioperative analgesic compared to intravenous (IV) opioids like tramadol in patients undergoing mastectomy surgery for breast cancer. After institutional ethics committee approval, we randomized 60 patients with breast cancer into 2 groups. In buprenorphine group, patients received 200 μg of SL buprenorphine thrice daily and in tramadol group patients received 100 mg of IV tramadol thrice daily. The analgesic efficacy of SL buprenorphine was comparable to that of IV tramadol. Visual Analogue Scale scores had no significant difference between the two groups at various time frames (0, 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 hours) at rest and movement except at 0 and 3 hours during movement when the score was lower in the tramadol group than the buprenorphine group. Four patients in the buprenorphine group received rescue analgesic (IV morphine 3 mg). Analgesic efficacy of SL buprenorphine appears comparable to IV tramadol for managing postoperative pain after mastectomy. SL buprenorphine can be administered sublingually, which is an advantage.',\n","       'Molecular signaling network and therapeutic developments in breast cancer brain metastasis.Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers in women worldwide. It has surpassed lung cancer as the leading cause of cancer-related death. Breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) is becoming a major clinical concern that is commonly associated with ER-ve and HER2+ve subtypes of BC patients. Metastatic lesions in the brain originate when the cancer cells detach from a primary breast tumor and establish metastatic lesions and infiltrate near and distant organs via systemic blood circulation by traversing the BBB. The colonization of BC cells in the brain involves a complex interplay in the tumor microenvironment (TME), metastatic cells, and brain cells like endothelial cells, microglia, and astrocytes. BCBM is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality and presents a challenge to developing successful cancer therapy. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanism of BCBM and novel therapeutic strategies for patients with brain metastatic BC.',\n","       'Curcumol, a major terpenoid from Curcumae Rhizoma, attenuates human uterine leiomyoma cell development via the p38MAPK/NF-κB pathway.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Uterine fibroids (UFs) are the most common benign tumors in women of reproductive age. Curcumae Rhizoma, the main essential oil component of which is curcumol, is widely used for the treatment of phymatosis in China due to its antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antithrombin, anti-tissue fibrosis and anti-oxygen pharmacological activities, but its potential for the treatment of UFs has not been evaluated. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of curcumol intervention in human uterine leiomyoma cells (UMCs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Putative targets of curcumol intervention in UFs were identified using network pharmacology strategies. Molecular docking was performed to assess the binding affinity of curcumol to core targets. A concentration gradient of curcumol (0, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500\\xa0μM) or RU-486 (mifepristone, 0, 10, 20, 40, 50, and 100\\xa0μM) was applied to UMCs, and cell viability was detected by the CCK-8 assay. Cell apoptosis and cell cycle were examined by flow cytometry, and cell migration was assessed by a wound-healing assay. Additionally, the mRNA and protein expression levels of critical pathway components were evaluated by RT‒PCR and western blotting. Finally, the actions of curcumol on different tumor cell lines were summarized. RESULTS: Network pharmacology predicted 62 genes with roles in the treatment of UFs with curcumol, and MAPK14 (p38MAPK) displayed a higher interaction degree. GO enrichment and KEGG analyses revealed that the core genes were abundantly enriched in the MAPK signaling pathway. The molecular binding of curcumol to core targets was relatively stable. In UMCs, 200, 300 and 400\\xa0μM curcumol treatment for 24\\xa0h decreased cell viability compared with that in the control group, and the greatest effect was detected at 48\\xa0h and maintained until 72\\xa0h. Curcumol arrested cells in the G0/G1 phase and subsequently suppressed mitosis, promoted early apoptosis and reduced the degree of wound healing in a concentration-dependent manner in UMCs. Furthermore, 200\\xa0μM curcumol decreased the mRNA and protein expression of p38MAPK, the mRNA expression of NF-κB, and the protein expression of Ki-67 and increased the mRNA and protein expression of Caspase 9. Curcumol (300 and 400\\xa0μM) decreased the mRNA and protein expression of p38MAPK, NF-κB, and Ki-67 and increased the protein expression of Caspase 9 in UMCs. Curcumol was demonstrated to treat tumor cell lines, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer, liver cancer and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, but its effects on benign tumors have not yet been reported. CONCLUSION: Curcumol suppresses cell proliferation and cell migration while arresting the cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase and inducing cell apoptosis in UMCs via a mechanism related to p38MAPK/NF-κB pathway regulation. Curcumol may be a potential therapeutic and preventive agent in the treatment of benign tumors such as UFs.',\n","       'Manganese oxide-modified bismuth oxychloride piezoelectric nanoplatform with multiple enzyme-like activities for cancer sonodynamic therapy.Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is considered as a new-rising strategy for cancer therapeutics, but the inefficient production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by current sonosensitizers seriously hinders its further applications. Herein, a piezoelectric nanoplatform is fabricated for enhancing SDT against cancer, in which manganese oxide (MnO(x)) with multiple enzyme-like activities is loaded on the surface of piezoelectric bismuth oxychloride nanosheets (BiOCl NSs) to form a heterojunction. When exposed to ultrasound (US) irradiation, piezotronic effect can remarkably promote the separation and transport of US-induced free charges, and further enhance ROS generation in SDT. Meanwhile, the nanoplatform shows multiple enzyme-like activities from MnO(x), which can not only downregulate the intracellular glutathione (GSH) level, but also disintegrate endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) to generate oxygen (O(2)) and hydroxyl radicals (•OH). As a result, the anticancer nanoplatform substantially boosts ROS generation and reverses tumor hypoxia. Ultimately, it reveals remarkable biocompatibility and tumor suppression in a murine model of 4\\xa0T1 breast cancer under US irradiation. This work provides a feasible pathway for improving SDT using piezoelectric platforms.',\n","       'Breast cancer screening programmes and self-reported mammography use in European countries.Mammography screening has been shown to be able to reduce breast cancer mortality, leading most European countries to implement mammography-based screening programmes. In our study, we analysed key characteristics of breast cancer screening programmes and mammography use in European countries. Information on screening programmes were obtained from the 2017 European Union (EU) screening report, websites from governments and cancer registries, and through literature search in PubMed (studies published up to 20 June 2022). Data on self-reported mammography use in the past 2\\u2009years were obtained from Eurostat and had been derived from the European health interview survey (cross-sectional survey), conducted in the 27 EU countries, Iceland, Norway, Serbia, Turkey and the UK in 2013 to 2015 and 2018 to 2020. Data were analysed for each country according to their human development index (HDI). By 2022, all included countries besides Bulgaria and Greece had introduced an organised mammography-based screening programme; Romania and Turkey had only pilot programmes. Screening programmes differ substantially across countries, particularly in timing of implementation (e.g., in Sweden, the Netherlands before 1990; Belgium, France between 2000 and 2004; Denmark, Germany between 2005 and 2009; Austria, Slovakia after 2010). Self-reported mammography use also differed considerably across countries, and went along with HDI-from <36% in all countries with HDI <0.85 to >70% in most countries with HDI >0.90. The data call for efforts to improve mammography screening use across Europe, particularly in countries with lower development levels where breast cancer mortality rates are also among the highest in the region.',\n","       'Differential optineurin expression controls TGFβ signaling and is a key determinant for metastasis of triple negative breast cancer.Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most challenging breast cancer subtype to treat due to its aggressive characteristics and low response to the existing clinical therapies. Distant metastasis is the main cause of death of TNBC patients. Better understanding of the mechanisms underlying TNBC metastasis may lead to new strategies of early diagnosis and more efficient treatment. In our study, we uncovered that the autophagy receptor optineurin (OPTN) plays an unexpected role in TNBC metastasis. Data mining of publicly available data bases revealed that the mRNA level of OPTN in TNBC patients positively correlates with relapse free and distance metastasis free survival. Importantly, in vitro and in vivo models demonstrated that OPTN suppresses TNBC metastasis. Mechanistically, OPTN inhibited the pro-oncogenic transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) signaling in TNBC cells by interacting with TGFβ type I receptor (TβRI) and promoting its ubiquitination for degradation. Consistent with our experimental findings, the clinical TNBC samples displayed a negative correlation between OPTN mRNA expression and TGFβ gene response signature and expression of proto-typic TGFβ target genes. Altogether, our study demonstrates that OPTN is a negative regulator for TGFβ receptor/SMAD signaling and suppresses metastasis in TNBC.',\n","       'The effect of cognitive behavioural therapy integrated with activity pacing on cancer-related fatigue, depression and quality of life among patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy in Ethiopia: A randomised clinical trial.Fatigue is a common symptom experienced by 80% of individuals who receive chemotherapy and is one of the major factors that affect quality of life (QoL) of patients with breast cancer. Our study aimed to assess the effect of cognitive behavioural therapy integrated with activity pacing (CBT-AP) on cancer-related fatigue among patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. A parallel-group, randomised controlled trial was conducted. Severely fatigued patients were randomly assigned to the CBT-AP or usual care (UC) groups using a computer-generated random sequence. The new intervention was designed for seven sessions: three 2-hour face-to-face and four 30-minute telephone sessions. The primary outcome (fatigue severity) and the secondary outcomes (depression and QoL) were assessed at the end of the intervention and after 3\\xa0months. The data were analysed by repeated measures analyses of covariance (RM-ANCOVA). CBT-AP had a significant time effect (P\\u2009<\\u2009.001, ηp(2) \\xa0=\\xa00.233) in reducing fatigue from baseline (adjusted mean\\xa0=\\xa07.48) to the end of the intervention (adjusted mean\\xa0=\\xa06.37) and the 3-month follow-up (adjusted mean\\xa0=\\xa06.54). Compared to the UC group, the CBT-AP group had lower fatigue and depression scores, and higher global health status scores. The group × time interaction revealed a significant reduction in fatigue and depression in the CBT-AP group compared to the UC group. Therefore, CBT-AP appears to be effective in reducing fatigue and depression and improving QoL in patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. It is highly recommended to integrate a CBT-AP intervention in routine cancer care.',\n","       'Advances in \"adiponcosis\": Insights in the inner mechanisms at the base of adipose and tumour tissues interplay.The epidemic spread of obesity is nowadays recognized as a global health and economic burden, arising great interest in the scientific community. The rate of adult obesity steadily increases concomitantly with the cancer incidence. As has been comprehensively reported, obesity is included among the multiple cancer risk factors and can progressively cause and/or exacerbate certain cancer types, as colorectal and breast cancers. The term adiponcosis was forged precisely to emphasize the interconnection between obesity and cancer onset and progression. The underlying mechanisms of adiponcosis have not been fully elucidated yet, may vary on cancer type, and depend on body fat distribution. It has been proposed that insulin resistance and related chronic hyperinsulinemia, increased insulin-like growth factors production, chronic inflammation or increased bioavailability of steroid hormones could be responsible of cancer hallmarks. Additionally, it has been suggested that adipose tissue-derived hormones, cytokines and adipokines, such as leptin, adiponectin and inflammatory markers, may reflect mechanisms linked to tumorigenesis. This review summarizes the current evidence on pathways, hormones, cytokines and low-chronic inflammation subtending adiponconsis, focusing on breast and colorectal cancers. In addition, we analyzed the lifestyle interventions that could attenuate the driving forces of obesity-related cancer incidence and progression. Moreover, current targets and drugs, their pros and cons, as well as new mechanisms and targets with promising therapeutic potential in cancer are discussed. Depicting this complex interconnection will provide insights for establishing new therapeutic approaches to halt the obesity impacts and thwart cancer onset and progression.',\n","       'Spectroscopic studies on noncovalent binding of nicotinamide-modified BRCA1 (856-871) analogs to calf thymus DNA.Various peptide drugs have entered the market with the development of molecular biology. Peptide drugs are used for treat diseases such as diabetes, breast cancer, and HIV infection. In this study, three nicotinamide-modified peptides were synthesized by modifying the N-terminus of BRCA1 (856-871, Y856R, K862Y, R866W) peptide with three nicotinic acid derivatives using solid-phase peptide synthesis. The results of calf thymus DNA (ctDNA) binding activity indicated that binding constants of BRCA1 (856-871, Y856R, K862Y, R866W) (P0) and three nicotinamide-modified peptides (P1, P2, and P3) to ctDNA were 1.89\\xa0×\\xa010(3), 2.97\\xa0×\\xa010(4), 7.61\\xa0×\\xa010(4), and 8.09\\xa0×\\xa010(4) L·mol(-1), respectively.

ΔH(θ)\\xa0<\\xa00 and ΔS(θ)\\xa0<\\xa00 indicated that van der Waals force and hydrogen bond contributed most to peptide-ctDNA binding. Results obtained by Circular dichroism (CD) indicated that peptide binding interaction led to conformational changes in ctDNA. Ultraviolet-visible (UV) spectroscopy, ethidium bromide (EB) competition experiments, DNA melting experiments, and viscosity measurements verified that peptides interacted with ctDNA via groove binding. Ionic strength experiments manifested that electrostatic binding was also involved in peptide-ctDNA binding.',\n","       'Pyridinic-N-rich carbon dots in IFE-based Turn-off Fluorometric detection of nerve agent Mimic- Diethyl chlorophosphate and multicolor cell imaging.Fluorometric sensors for the detection of nerve agent mimics have received a lot of interest nowadays due to their high sensitivity and selectivity, ease of operation, and real-time monitoring. Pyridinic-N-rich carbon dots (NCDs) prepared through microwave-assisted pyrolysis of l-Malic acid and urea have been explored first time in this work as a novel turn-off fluorescent probe for the sensitive and selective detection of diethyl chlorophosphate (DCP), a nerve agent mimic. The as-prepared carbon dots contained a large amount of pyridinic nitrogen on their surface, which can modulate the photoluminescence properties of the NCDs. The blue emissive NCDs possessed both excitation wavelength-dependent and independent emission behavior. The detection of DCP was premised on quenching of the fluorescence emission intensity of NCDs in the presence of similar chemical reagents (e.g., trimethyl phosphate, triethyl phosphate, triethyl phosphonoacetate, triphenyl phosphate, diphenyl phosphate, tributyl phosphate). Fluorescence quenching of the NCDs in the presence of DCP has been attributed to the inner filter effect (IFE). From the linear Stern-Volmer plot (R(2)\\xa0=\\xa00.9992), the limit of detection (LOD) was found to be 84\\xa0μM for sensing DCP for the concentration ranging between 3 and 15\\xa0mM.

Most studies have focused on the function of TXN in redox reactions, which is critical for tumor progression. Here, we showed that TXN promotes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) stemness properties in a non-redox-dependent manner, which has rarely been reported in previous studies. TXN exhibited upregulated expression in human HCC specimens, which was associated with a poor prognosis. Functional studies showed that TXN promoted HCC stemness properties and facilitated HCC metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, TXN promoted the stemness of HCC cells by interacting with BTB and CNC homology 1 (BACH1) and stabilized BACH1 expression by inhibiting its ubiquitination. BACH1 was positively correlated with TXN expression and was significantly upregulated in HCC. In addition, BACH1 promotes HCC stemness by activating the AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Furthermore, we found that the specific inhibition of TXN in combination with lenvatinib in mice significantly improved the treatment of metastatic HCC. In summary, our data demonstrate that TXN plays a crucial role in HCC stemness and BACH1 plays an integral part in regulating this process by activating the AKT/mTOR pathway. Thus, TXN is a promising target for metastatic HCC therapy.',\n","       'Near-infrared fluorescence angiography with indocyanine green for perfusion assessment of DIEP and msTRAM flaps: A Dutch multicenter randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: A common complication after a DIEP flap reconstruction is the occurrence of fat necrosis due to inadequate flap perfusion zones. Intraoperative identification of ischemic zones in the DIEP flap could be optimized using indocyanine green near-infrared fluorescence angiography (ICG-NIR-FA). This randomized controlled trial aims to determine whether intraoperative ICG-NIR-FA for the assessment of DIEP flap perfusion decreases the occurrence of fat necrosis. DESIGN/METHODS: This article describes the protocol of a Dutch multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial: the FAFI-trial. Females who are electively scheduled for autologous breast reconstruction using DIEP or muscle-sparing transverse rectus abdominis muscle (msTRAM) flaps are included. A total of 280 patients will be included in a 1:1 ratio between both study arms. In the intervention arm, the intraoperative assessment of flap perfusion will be based on both regular clinical parameters and ICG-NIR-FA. The control arm consists of flap perfusion evaluation only through the regular clinical parameters, while ICG-NIR-FA images are obtained during surgery for which the surgeon is blinded. The main study endpoint is the difference in percentage of clinically relevant fat necrosis between both study arms, evaluated two weeks and three months after reconstruction. CONCLUSION: The FAFI-trial, a Dutch multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial, aims to investigate the clinical added value of intraoperative use of standardized ICG-NIR-FA for assessment of DIEP/msTRAM flap perfusion in the reduction of fat necrosis.

Epidemiological data suggest a possible link between EL exposure and breast cancer risk. However, EL binds to estrogen receptor-α, produces estrogen-like effects on gene expression, and induces proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells at a concentration of 10 µM. Here, we present RNA-seq data obtained from MCF-7 breast cancer cells treated with 10 µM EL for a period of 72 h, which captures the transcriptomic alterations associated with cell proliferation.

Despite great advances in the therapeutic strategies, the survival rate in the past decades of patients with breast cancer remains unsatisfactory. Growing evidence has demonstrated that Curcumae Rhizoma, called Ezhu in Chinese, showed various pharmacological properties, including anti-bacterial, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor activities. It has been widely used in Chinese medicine to treat many types of human cancer. PURPOSE: To comprehensively summarize and analyze the effects of active substances in Curcumae Rhizoma on breast cancer malignant phenotypes and the underlying mechanisms, as well as discuss its medicinal value and future perspectives. METHOD: We used \"Curcumae Rhizoma\" or the name of crude extracts and bioactive components in Curcumae Rhizoma in combination with \"breast cancer\" as key words. Studies focusing on their anti-breast cancer activities and mechanisms of action were extracted from Pubmed, Web of Science and CNKI databases up to October 2022. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guideline was followed. RESULTS: Crude extracts and 7 main bioactive phytochemicals (curcumol, β-elemene, furanodiene, furanodienone, germacrone, curdione and curcumin) isolated from Curcumae Rhizoma have shown many anti-breast cancer pharmacological properties, including inhibiting cell proliferation, migration, invasion and stemness, reversing chemoresistance, and inducing cell apoptosis, cycle arrest and ferroptosis. The mechanisms of action were involved in regulating MAPK, PI3K/AKT and NF-κB signaling pathways. In vivo and clinical studies demonstrated that these compounds exhibited high anti-tumor efficacy and safety against breast cancer. CONCLUSION: These findings provide strong evidence that Curcumae Rhizoma acts as a rich source of phytochemicals and has robust anti-breast cancer properties.',\n","       'Panax notoginseng saponins normalises tumour blood vessels by inhibiting EphA2 gene expression to modulate the tumour microenvironment of breast cancer.BACKGROUND: Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS), the main active component of Panax notoginseng, can promote vascular microcirculation. PNS exhibits antitumor effects in various cancers. However, the molecular basis of the relationship between PNS and tumor blood vessels remains unclear. PURPOSE: To study the relationship between PNS inhibiting the growth and metastasis of breast cancer and promoting the normalization of blood vessels. METHODS: We performed laser speckle imaging of tumor microvessels and observed the effects of PNS on tumor growth and metastasis of MMTV-PyMT (FVB) spontaneous breast cancer in a transgenic mouse model. Immunohistochemical staining of Ki67 and CD31 was performed for tumors, scanning electron microscopy was used to observe tumor vascular morphology, and flow cytometry was used to detect tumor tissue immune microenvironment (TME). RNA-seq analysis was performed using the main vessels of the tumor tissues of the mice. HUVECs were cultured in tumor supernatant in vitro to simulate tumor microenvironment and verify the sequencing differential key genes. RESULTS: After treatment with PNS, we observed that tumor growth was suppressed, the blood perfusion of the systemic tumor microvessels in the mice increased, and the number of lung metastases decreased. Moreover, the vascular density of the primary tumor increased, and the vascular epidermis was smoother and flatter. Moreover, the number of tumor-associated macrophages in the tumor microenvironment was reduced, and the expression levels of IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α were reduced in the tumor tissues. PNS downregulated the expression of multiple genes associated with tumor angiogenesis, migration, and adhesion. In vitro tubule formation experiments revealed that PNS promoted the formation and connection of tumor blood vessels and normalized the vessel morphology primarily by inhibiting EphA2 expression. In addition, PNS inhibited the expression of tumor vascular marker proteins and vascular migration adhesion-related proteins in vivo. CONCLUSION: In this study, we found that PNS promoted the generation and connection of tumor vascular endothelial cells, revealing the key role of EphA2 in endothelial cell adhesion and tumor blood vessel morphology. PNS can inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of breast cancer by inhibiting EphA2, improving the immune microenvironment of breast cancer and promoting the normalization of tumor blood vessels.',\n","       'Role of the voltage‑gated sodium channel Nav1.6 in glioma and candidate drugs screening.Gliomas remain a clinical challenge, common and fatal. Treatment of glioblastoma remains elusive, and researchers have focused on discovering new mechanisms and drugs. It has been well established that the expression of voltage‑gated sodium channels (VGSCs) is abnormally increased in numerous malignancies and, in general, is rarely expressed in the corresponding normal tissues. This suggests that ion channel activity appears to be associated with malignant progression of tumors. VGSCs remain largely unknown as to how their activity leads to an increase in cancer cell activity or invasiveness. Certain sodium ion channel subtypes (for instance, Nav1.5 and Nav1.7) are associated with metastasis and invasion in cancers including breast and colorectal cancers. A previous study by the authors explored the expression of certain ion channels in glioma, but there are few studies related to Nav1.6. The current study aimed to elucidate the expression and role of Nav1.6 in glioma and to screen potential drugs for the treatment of glioma by virtual screening and drug sensitivity analysis. Nav1.6 relative expression of mRNA and protein was determined by reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR and western blot analysis. Cell proliferation was determined by Cell Counting Kit‑8 assay. Cell migration was assessed by cellular wound healing assay. Cell invasion and apoptosis were detected by Transwell cell invasion assay and flow cytometry. Last but not least, FDA‑approved drugs were screened using virtual screening, molecular docking and NCI‑60 drug sensitivity analyses based on the expression and structure of Nav1.6. In glioma cells, Nav1.6 was significantly upregulated and expressed mostly in the cytoplasm and cell membrane; its expression was positively correlated with pathological grade. A172 and U251 cells exhibited reduced proliferation, migration and invasion when Nav1.6 expression was knocked down, and apoptosis was increased. TNF‑α (100\\xa0pg/ml) acting on glioma cells was found to upregulate the expression level of Nav1.6, and TNF‑α was involved in the process of Nav1.6 promoting malignant progression of glioma. Finally, certain FDA‑approved drugs were identified by virtual screening and drug sensitivity analysis. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated the expression and role of Nav1.6 in glioma and identified several FDA‑approved drugs that are highly correlated with Nav1.6 and could be candidate drugs for patients with glioma.',\n","       'A review of nemorosone: Chemistry and biological properties.Nemorosone is a bicyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinol derivative originally isolated from Clusia spp. and it can be obtained through chemical synthesis employing different synthetic strategies. Since its discovery, it has attracted great attention both from a biological and chemical viewpoint. In the present article, we attempted to review various chemical and biological topics around nemorosone, with an emphasis on its antiproliferative activities. For this purpose, relevant data was collected from different scientific databases including Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus and ISI Web of Knowledge. This natural compound has shown activity against several types of malignancies such as leukemia, human colorectal, pancreatic, and breast cancer because it modulates multiple molecular pathways. Nemorosone has both cytostatic and cytotoxic activity and it also seems to induce apoptosis and ferroptosis. Additionally, it has antimicrobial capabilities against Gram-positive bacteria and parasites belonging to genus Leishmania.

HDAC2 is not only responsible for enhancing tumor cell growth, development, and anti-apoptosis, but also plays a significant role in regulating PD-L1 on the surface of tumor cells. Continuous expression of PD-L1 allows tumor cells to escape immune surveillance. There is not much research on how HDAC2 affects the immune system in breast cancer. Ginsenoside Rh4 (Rh4) is a major rare saponin in heat-treated ginseng, which is widely applied in treating and preventing various diseases because of its potent medicinal value and stable safety. However, it is unclear how Rh4 affects the tumor immune microenvironment in breast cancer. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the effect of Rh4 on HDAC2 in breast cancer, specifically the effect of HDAC2 on apoptosis and the immune microenvironment to inhibit breast cancer growth. According to our study, ginsenoside Rh4 has been shown to significantly suppress breast cancer cell proliferation without any adverse effects. The molecular docking results of Rh4 and HDAC2 indicate a binding energy of -6.06\\xa0kcal/mol, suggesting the potential of Rh4 as a targeting modulator of HDAC2. Mechanistically, Rh4 induces apoptosis of breast cancer cells by the HDAC2-mediated caspase pathway and inhibits the HDAC2-mediated JAK/STAT pathway to regulate the immune microenvironment, which inhibits breast cancer growth. Specifically, Rh4 was shown for the first time to blockade immune checkpoints (PD-1/PD-L1) and increase levels of T-lymphocytes in the tumor. In a word, our study establishes a theoretical framework for applying Rh4 as an immune checkpoint inhibitor as part of breast cancer treatment.',\n","       \"Aqua polo: Preliminary feasibility and efficacy study of a programme of adapted, supervised water polo to reduce fatigue and improve women's psychological and social recovery after breast cancer treatment: A mixed-methods design.Physical activity has been shown to have many benefits, including reducing cancer-related fatigue (CRF) and improving psychological and physical recovery from breast cancer. Some authors have shown the benefits of aquatic practice, while others have detailed the benefits of group and supervised practice. We hypothesize that an innovative sports coaching proposal could allow a significant adherence of patients and contribute to their health improvement. The main objective is to study the feasibility of an adapted water polo programme (aqua polo) for women after breast cancer. Secondarily we will analyse the effect of such a practice on patients' recovery and study the relationship between coaches and participants. The use of mixed methods will allow us to question the underlying processes precisely. This is a prospective, non-randomized, monocentric study with a sample of 24 breast cancer patients after treatment. The intervention is a 20 week programme (1 session per week) of aqua polo in a swim club facility, supervised by professional water-polo coaches. The variables measured are patient participation, quality of life (QLQ BR23), CRF (R-PFS) and post-traumatic growth (PTG-I) as well as different variables to observe physical capacity (strength with dynamometer, step-test and arm amplitude). The quality of the coach-patient relationship will be evaluated (CART-Q) to explore its dynamics. Participatory observations and interviews will be carried out to report on the interactions between the coach and the participants during the sessions.

Despite durable responses, eventual endocrine resistance results in disease progression. The Src/Abl pathway has been shown to mediate endocrine resistance in breast cancer, thus providing a promising target for novel therapies. Bosutinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets the Src/Abl pathway, which has been studied in hematologic malignancies. Preclinical data suggests that the addition of bosutinib to a CDK4/6 inhibitor and antiestrogen therapy has the potential to reverse endocrine resistance. This is a phase I, single arm, open-label clinical trial in which we evaluate the combination of palbociclib and fulvestrant with bosutinib in metastatic HR+\\xa0breast cancer. Patients with confirmed advanced HR+/HER2- breast cancer who have received no more than three lines of chemotherapy and have progressed on at least one aromatase inhibitor and one CDK4/6 inhibitor will be enrolled. Participants will be given a combination of palbociclib, fulvestrant and bosutinib over 28-day cycles. The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of bosutinib in combination with palbociclib and fulvestrant in the study population. Secondary objectives are to 1) determine the anti-tumor effect of this therapeutic combination by assessing overall response rate (ORR) and clinical benefit rate (CBR) after 6 months of treatment, 2) to determine the clinical pharmacology parameters of bosutinib in this regimen, and 3) to build a tissue repository at Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center for further translational study.',\n","       'Multi compartmental 3D breast cancer disease model-recapitulating tumor complexity in in-vitro.Breast cancer is the most common ailment among women. In 2020, it had the highest incidence of any type of cancer. Many Phase II and III anti-cancer drugs fail due to efficacy, durability, and side effects. Thus, accelerated drug screening models must be accurate. In-vivo models have been used for a long time, but delays, inconsistent results, and a greater sense of responsibility among scientists toward wildlife have led to the search for in-vitro alternatives. Stromal components support breast cancer growth and survival. Multi-compartment Transwell models may be handy instruments. Co-culturing breast cancer cells with endothelium and fibroblasts improves modelling. The extracellular matrix (ECM) supports native 3D hydrogels in natural and polymeric forms. 3D Transwell cultured tumor spheroids mimicked in-vivo pathological conditions. Tumor invasion, migration, Trans-endothelial migration, angiogenesis, and spread are studied using comprehensive models. Transwell models can create a cancer niche and conduct high-throughput drug screening, promising future applications. Our comprehensive shows how 3D in-vitro multi compartmental models may be useful in producing breast cancer stroma in Transwell culture.',\n","       'Synthesis of structurally diverse derivatives of aconitine-type diterpenoid alkaloids and their anti-proliferative effects on canine breast cancer cells.As one of the most common malignancies in female dogs, no drugs have been developed specifically for the treatment of canine mammary carcinoma. In our previous study, a series of diterpenoid alkaloids derivatives were synthesized and exhibited good anti-proliferative activity in vitro against both normal and adriamycin-resistant human breast cancer cells lines. In this study, a series of structurally diverse aconitine-type alkaloids derivatives were also synthesized basing on the minimal modification principle, by modifying on A-ring, C-ring, D-ring, N-atom or salt formation on aconitine skeleton. Their anti-proliferative effects and mechanism on canine mammary cancer cells were investigated, exhibiting the importance of the substitution at A ring, the long chain ester at the C8, the hydroxyl group at the C13, the phenyl ring at the C14 and the N-ethyl group, while the methoxy group at the C1 and C16 showed little effect on the activity. The results of the proliferation, apoptosis and ultrastructure tests of the treated canine mammary carcinoma cells referred that the representative compound, aconitine linoleate (25) could block the cell cycle of canine mammary carcinoma cells in the G0/G1 phase, and exhibit the anti-proliferative effect by inducing apoptosis.',\n","       'Exosomal delivery of 7SK long non-coding RNA suppresses viability, proliferation, aggressiveness and tumorigenicity in triple negative breast cancer cells.AIMS: RN7SK (7SK), a highly conserved non-coding RNA, serves as a transcription regulator via interaction with a few proteins. Despite increasing evidences which support the cancer-promoting roles of 7SK-interacting proteins, limited reports address the direct link between 7SK and cancer. To test the hypothetic suppression of cancer by overexpression of 7SK, the effects of exosomal 7SK delivery on cancer phenotypes were studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Exosomes derived from human mesenchymal stem cells were loaded with 7SK (Exo-7SK). MDA-MB-231, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), cell line was treated with Exo-7sk. Expression levels of 7SK were evaluated by qPCR. Cell viability was assessed via MTT and Annexin V/PI assays as well as qPCR assessment of apoptosis-regulating genes. Cell proliferation was evaluated by growth curve analysis, colony formation and cell cycle assays. Aggressiveness of TNBCs was evaluated via transwell migration and invasion assays and qPCR assessment of genes regulating epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Moreover, tumor formation ability was assessed using a nude mice xenograft model. KEY FINDINGS: Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with Exo-7SK resulted in efficient overexpression of 7SK; reduced viability; altered transcription levels of apoptosis-regulating genes; reduced proliferation; reduced migration and invasion; altered transcription of EMT-regulating genes; and reduced in vivo tumor formation ability. Finally, Exo-7SK reduced mRNA levels of HMGA1, a 7SK interacting protein with master gene regulatory and cancer promoting roles, and its bioinformatically-selected cancer promoting target genes. SIGNIFICANCE: Altogether, as a proof of the concept, our findings suggest that exosomal delivery of 7SK may suppress cancer phenotypes via downregulation of HMGA1.',\n","       'Glycyrrhetinic acid suppresses breast cancer metastasis by inhibiting M2-like macrophage polarization via activating JNK1/2 signaling.BACKGROUND: Breast cancer metastasis is leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have been considered as potential targets for treating breast cancer metastasis because they promote tumor growth and development. Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) is one of the most important phytochemicals of licorice which has shown promising anti-cancer efficacies in pre-clinical trials. However, the regulatory effect of GA on the polarization of TAMs remains elusive. PURPOSE: To investigate the role of GA in regulating the polarization of M2 macrophages and inhibiting breast cancer metastasis, and to further explore its underlying mechanisms of action. STUDY DESIGN: IL-4 / IL-13-treated RAW 264.7 and THP-1 cells were used as the M2-polarized macrophages in vitro. A 4T1 mouse breast cancer model and the tail vein breast cancer metastasis model were applied to study the effect of GA on breast cancer growth and metastasis in vivo. RESULTS: In vitro studies showed that GA significantly inhibited IL-4 / IL 13-induced M2-like polarization in RAW 264.7 and THP-1 macrophages without affecting M1-like polarization. GA strongly decreased the expression of M2 macrophage markers CD206 and Arg-1, and reduced the levels of the pro-angiogenic molecules VEGF, MMP9, MMP2 and IL-10 in M2 macrophages. GA also increased the phosphorylation of JNK1/2 in M2 macrophages. Moreover, GA significantly suppressed M2 macrophage-induced cell proliferation and migration in 4T1 cancer cells and HUVECs. Interestingly, the inhibitory effects of GA on M2 macrophages were abolished by a JNK inhibitor. Animal studies showed that GA significantly suppressed tumor growth, angiogenesis, and lung metastasis in BALB/c mice bearing breast tumor. In tumor tissues, GA reduced the number of M2 macrophages but elevated the proportion of M1 macrophages, accompanied by activation of JNK signaling. Similar results were found in the tail vein breast cancer metastasis model. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated for the first time that GA could effectively suppress breast cancer growth and metastasis by inhibiting macrophage M2 polarization via activating JNK1/2 signaling. These findings indicate that GA could be served as the lead compound for the future development of anti-breast cancer drug.',\n","       'Isorhamnetin induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by triggering DNA damage and regulating the AMPK/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway in doxorubicin-resistant breast cancer.BACKGROUND: Acquired resistance to doxorubicin (DOX) inevitably limits its clinical use against breast cancer (BC). Isorhamnetin (IS), a native flavonoid which extensively available in vegetables, fruits, and phytomedicine, has been deemed to the probable cancer chemopreventive agent in preceding explorations since it exhibits satisfied antitumor activity. So far, the strategy for alleviating DOX resistance by using IS as a sensitizer against resistant BC has not yet been covered. PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of IS on potentiating the chemoreceptivity of drug-resistant BC cells to DOX in vitro and in vivo and elucidate the possible molecular mechanisms. METHODS: MTS assays, colony formation assays, three-dimensional (3D) tumor spheroid model, and migration assay were deployed to verify the inhibiting action of IS in the presence or absence of DOX on resistant BC cells in vitro. Apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and endocellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined by flow cytometry. Protein levels were monitored by western blotting. Nuclear staining and EdU proliferation were photographed with a confocal laser scanning microscope. The effects of the IS and DOX combination on the tumorigenesis in the xenograft experiments were evaluated for further confirming the in vitro cytotoxicity. RESULTS: IS significantly inhibited cell proliferation and migration and enhanced the antitumor competence of DOX against resistant BC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Adjuvant IS (50\\xa0μM) effectively enhanced the proapoptotic impacts of DOX in resistant BC cells (35.38\\xa0±\\xa03.18%, vs. 5.83\\xa0±\\xa00.68% in the DOX group) by suppressing the expression of bcl 2 in addition to enhancing cleaved caspase 3, ultimately leading to DNA condensation and fragmentation. IS (20, 30, and 50\\xa0μM) treatments induced significant increases in the G2/M populations (41.60\\xa0±\\xa01.28%, 44.60\\xa0±\\xa01.14%, and 50.64\\xa0±\\xa00.67%, vs. 35.84\\xa0±\\xa01.56% in the untreated control in MCF7/ADR cells, p < 0.01) via regulating CDK1/Cyclin B1 complex expression, subsequently triggering the inhibition of BC proliferation. In addition, IS (10, 20, 30, and 50\\xa0μM) stimulated the production of interstitial ROS in MCF7/ADR cells, by 3.99-, 4.20-, 6.29-, and 6.78-fold, respectively, versus the untreated group (p < 0.001), which were involved in DNA damage and AMPK-caused intercept of the mTOR/p70S6K signaling. CONCLUSION: Our study suggested the anti-breast cancer actions of IS as a DOX sensitizer and expounded the underlying molecular mechanisms, showing that IS could be deemed to a capable alternative for resistant BC cure.',\n","       'DNA-binding affinity and molecular docking studies of the PEGylated binuclear palladacycle, BTC2, an efficient metallodrug against triple-negative breast cancer.Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has a low five-year survival rate, especially if the cancer is diagnosed at a late stage and has already metastasized beyond the breast tissue. Current chemotherapeutic options for TNBC rely on traditional platinum-containing drugs like cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin. Unfortunately, these drugs are indiscriminately toxic, resulting in severe side effects and the development of drug resistance. Palladium compounds have shown to be viable alternatives to platinum complexes since they are less toxic and have displayed selectivity towards the TNBC cell lines. Here we report the design, synthesis, and characterization of a series of binuclear benzylidene palladacycles with varying phosphine bridging ligands. From this series we have identified BTC2 to be more soluble (28.38-56.77\\xa0μg/mL) and less toxic than its predecessor, AJ5, while maintaining its anticancer properties (IC(50) (MDA-MB-231)\\xa0=\\xa00.58\\xa0±\\xa00.012\\xa0μM). To complement the previous cell death pathway study of BTC2, we investigated the DNA and BSA binding properties of BTC2 through various spectroscopic and electrophoretic techniques, as well as molecular docking studies. We demonstrate that BTC2 displays multimodal DNA binding properties as both a partial intercalator and groove binder, with the latter being the predominant mode of action. BTC2 was also able to quench the fluorescence of BSA, thereby suggesting that the compound could be transported by albumin in mammalian cells. Molecular docking studies revealed that BTC2 is a major groove binder and binds preferentially to subdomain IIB of BSA. This study provides insight into the influence of the ligands on the activity of the binuclear palladacycles and provides much needed information on the mechanisms through which these complexes elicit their potent anticancer activity.',\n","       'A review of quantitative diffusion-weighted MR imaging for breast cancer: Towards noninvasive biomarker.Quantitative diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is an important adjunct to conventional breast MRI and shows promise as a noninvasive biomarker of breast cancer in multiple clinical scenarios, from the discrimination of benign and malignant lesions, prediction, and evaluation of treatment response to a prognostic assessment of breast cancer. Various quantitative parameters are derived from different DWI models based on special prior knowledge and assumptions, have different meanings, and are easy to confuse. In this review, we describe the quantitative parameters derived from conventional and advanced DWI models commonly used in breast cancer and summarize the promising clinical applications of these quantitative parameters. Although promising, it is still challenging for these quantitative parameters to become clinically useful noninvasive biomarkers in breast cancer, as multiple factors may result in variations in quantitative parameter measurements. Finally, we briefly describe some considerations regarding the factors that cause variations.',\n","       \"Anaesthesia and cancer recurrence: the influence of perioperative anaesthetic technique on cancer recurrence after surgery.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, and incidence is increasing. Excisional surgery is essential in approximately 70% of solid organ tumours. Emerging research in onco-anaesthesiology suggests that perioperative anaesthetic and analgesic techniques might influence long-term oncologic outcomes. RECENT FINDINGS: Prospective, randomized control trials (RCTs) demonstrate that perioperative regional and neuraxial anaesthetic techniques do not affect cancer recurrence. Ongoing trials are investigating the potential outcome benefits of systemic lidocaine. Retrospective studies indicate improved postoperative oncologic outcomes for certain types of breast cancer with higher intraoperative opioid dosage, nuancing available evidence on the effect of opioids. RCT evidence suggests that propofol has no beneficial effect compared with volatiles on breast cancer recurrence, although it remains unclear whether this applies to other cancer types. SUMMARY: Although regional anaesthesia definitively does not affect cancer recurrence, ongoing prospective RCTs with oncological outcomes as primary endpoints are awaited to establish if other anaesthetic or analgesic techniques influence cancer recurrence. Until such trials conclusively identify a causal relationship, insufficient evidence exists to recommend specific anaesthetic or analgesic techniques for tumour resection surgery based on altering the patient's risk of recurrence.\",\n","       'Development of certain aminoquinazoline scaffolds as potential multitarget anticancer agents with apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects: Design, synthesis and biological evaluation.Newly designed 4 11a, b, 12a, b and 13a, b) have been synthesized and evaluated for their potential multitarget anticancer activities, apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects. Thereupon, in vitro cytotoxic activities of all the synthesized compounds were screened against NCI 60 human cancer cell lines (nine subpanels) at NCI, USA.

Western blotting analysis of compound 5e against melanoma LOX IMVI marked out significant reduced EGFR and CDK2 protein expression percentages, up to 32.97% and 34.09%, respectively, if compared to lapatinib (31.18%) and ribociclib (29.66%). Moreover, compound 5e caused clear cell cycle arrests at S phase of renal UO-31 cells and at G1 phase of both breast cancer MCF7 and ovarian cancer IGROV1, associated with remarkable increase of DNA content of the controls. In accordance, it demonstrated promising anti- proliferative and apoptotic activities, showing a significant increase in total apoptotic percentages of renal cancer UO-31, breast cancer MCF7 and ovarian IGROV1 cancer cell lines, if compared to the control untreated cells (from 1.79% to 46.72%, 2.19% to 39.02% and 1.66 to 42.51%, respectively). Molecular modelling and dynamic simulation study results supported the main objectives of the present work.',\n","       'Oxidative stress mediates the associations between phthalate exposures and thyroid cancer/benign nodule risk.Epidemiological studies have suggested that phthalate exposures are associated with increased risks of thyroid cancer and benign nodule, while the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we explored the mediation effects of oxidative stress (OS) biomarkers in the associations between phthalate exposures and the risks of thyroid cancer and benign nodule. Urine samples collected from 143 thyroid cancer, 136 nodule patients, and 141 healthy controls were analyzed for 8 phthalate metabolites and 3 OS biomarkers [8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal-mercapturic acid (HNE-MA), and 8-iso-prostaglandin F(2α) (8-isoPGF(2α))]. Multivariable linear or logistic regression models were used to explore the associations of OS biomarkers with phthalate metabolite concentrations and the risks of thyroid cancer and nodule. The mediation role of OS biomarkers was also investigated. Urinary monoethyl phthalate (MEP), monomethyl phthalate (MMP), mono (2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), mono (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), and mono (2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP) were positively associated with at least 2 OS biomarkers (all P-values<0.01), and part of these positive associations varied in different subgroups. All 3 OS biomarkers were positively associated with the risks of thyroid nodule and cancer (P-values<0.001). The mediation analysis showed that OS biomarkers significantly mediated the associations between urinary MEHOP concentration and nodule, as well as between urinary MMP, MEHP, and MEHHP concentrations and cancer and nodule, with the estimated proportions of mediation ranging from 15.8% to 85.6%. Our results suggest that OS is a potential mediating mechanism through which phthalate exposures induce thyroid carcinogenesis and nodular formation.',\n","       'Interaction of neutral and protonated Tamoxifen with the DPPC lipid bilayer using molecular dynamics simulation.Tamoxifen as an antiestrogen is successfully applied for the clinical treatment of breast cancer in pre- and post-menopausal women. Due to the side effects related to the oral administration of Tamoxifen (such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, hot flushes, ocular disturbances and some types of cancer), liposomal drug delivery is recommended for taking this drug. Drug encapsulation in a liposomal or lipid drug delivery system improves the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. In this regard, we carried out 200-ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for three systems (pure DPPC and neutral and protonated Tamoxifen-loaded DPPC). Here, DPPC is a model lipid bilayer to provide us with conditions like liposomal drug delivery systems to investigate the interactions between Tamoxifen and DPPC lipid bilayers and to estimate the preferred location and orientation of the drug molecule inside the bilayer membrane. Properties such as area per lipid, membrane thickness, lateral diffusion coefficient, order parameters and mass density, were surveyed. With insertion of neutral and protonated Tamoxifen inside the DPPC lipid bilayers, area per lipid and membrane thickness increased slightly. Also, Tamoxifen induce ordering of the hydrocarbon chains in DPPC bilayer. Analysis of MD trajectories shows that neutral Tamoxifen is predominantly found in the hydrophobic tail region, whereas protonated Tamoxifen is located at the lipid-water interface (polar region of DPPC lipid bilayers).',\n","       'Oxypalmatine regulates proliferation and apoptosis of breast cancer cells by inhibiting PI3K/AKT signaling and its efficacy against breast cancer organoids.BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) is known as the most common cancer in women. Discovering novel and effective drugs is a priority for the treatment of BC. Oxypalmatine (OPT) is a natural protoberberine-type alkaloid isolated from Phellodendron amurense Rupr. (Rutaceae) with potential anti-cancer activity. PURPOSE: This investigation aimed to elucidate the biological role and potential mechanisms of OPT in BC cells, and intended to assess the therapeutic potential of OPT in BC patient-derived organoid models. METHODS: CCK-8 and EdU assays, and flow cytometry were used to test the activity of OPT against BC cells. In addition, patient-derived organoid models were constructed to assess the therapeutic efficiency of OPT in BC. Besides, network pharmacological analysis and RNA sequencing analysis were performed to predict the underlying anti-BC mechanism of OPT. Moreover, Western blot analysis was applied to test the expression of genes modulated by OPT. RESULTS: OPT attenuated the proliferation and DNA replication, and induced apoptosis in multiple BC cells. Interestingly, OPT also exerted a cytotoxic effect on BC organoids characterized as luminal A, HER2-overexpressing, and triple-negative subtypes, indicating that OPT was a potential broad-spectrum anticancer drug. Network pharmacological analysis suggested that OPT might affect signals contributing to BC progression, including PI3K/AKT, MAPK, and VEGFA-VEGFR2 signaling pathways. Moreover, bioinformatics analysis of data from our RNA sequencing suggested that PI3K/AKT was a downstream pathway of OPT in BC. Finally, OPT was shown to inactivate PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in BC cells by Western blot analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our study demonstrated that OPT suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis through mitigating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in BC cells. Moreover, our work first adopted BC organoid models to confirm OPT as an effective and promising drug, laying a foundation for the potential use of OPT in BC treatment.',\n","       'β,\\xa0β-Dimethylacrylshikonin potentiates paclitaxel activity, suppresses immune evasion and triple negative breast cancer progression via STAT3Y705 phosphorylation inhibition based on network pharmacology and transcriptomics analysis.BACKGOUND: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an extremely aggressive and rapidly progressing cancer, wherein existing therapies provide little benefit to patients. β, β-Dimethylacrylshikonin (DMAS), an active naphthoquinone derived from comfrey root, has potent anticancer activity. However, the antitumor function of DMAS against TNBC remains to be proved. PURPOSE: Explore effects of DMAS on TNBC and clarify the mechanism. STUDY DESIGN: Network pharmacology, transcriptomics and various cell functional experiments were applied to TNBC cells to explore the effects of DMAS on TNBC. The conclusions were further validated in xenograft animal models. METHODS: MTT, EdU, transwell, scratch tests, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and immunoblot were utilized to assess the activity of DMAS on three TNBC cell lines. The anti-TNBC mechanism of DMAS was clarified by overexpression and knockdown of STAT3 in BT-549 cells. In vivo efficacy of DMAS was analysed using a xenograft mouse model. RESULTS: In vitro analysis revealed that DMAS inhibited the G2/M phase transition and suppressed TNBC proliferation. Additionally, DMAS triggered mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis and reduced cell migration by antagonizing epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Mechanistically, DMAS exerted its antitumour effects by inhibiting STAT3Y705 phosphorylation. STAT3 overexpression abolished the inhibitory effect of DMAS. Further studies showed that treatment with DMAS inhibited TNBC growth in a xenograft model. Notably, DMAS potentiated the sensitivity of TNBC to paclitaxel and inhibited immune evasion by downregulating the immune checkpoint PD-L1. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, our study revealed that DMAS potentiates paclitaxel activity, suppresses immune evasion and TNBC progression by inhibiting STAT3 pathway. It has the potential as a promising agent for TNBC.',\n","       \"A colorimetric and photothermal dual-mode biosensing platform based on nanozyme-functionalized flower-like DNA structures for tumor-derived exosome detection.Tumor-derived exosomes can be served as a kind of promising biomarkers for early diagnosis of cancers. Herein, a colorimetric/photothermal dual-mode exosomes sensing platform is developed for human breast cancer cell (MCF-7)-derived exosomes based on encapsulation of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine-loaded graphene quantum dot nanozymes (TMB-GQDzymes) into DNA flowers (DFs) via rolling circle amplification (RCA). To achieve specific detection, EpCAM aptamer for MCF-7 cell-derived exosomes is immobilized on the well plate, while the complementary sequence of another CD63 aptamer is designed into the circular template to obtain abundant capture probes. Benefitting from the dual-aptamer recognition strategy, a sandwich structure of EpCAM aptamer/exosomes/TMB-GQDzymes@DFs is formed, in which the GQDzymes can catalyze the oxidation of TMB in the presence of H(2)O(2). The resulting products of TMB oxidation (oxTMB) can induce not only the absorption changes but also a near-infrared (NIR) laser-driven photothermal effect, achieving dual-mode detection of exosomes with the limit of detection (LOD) of 1027 particles/μL (colorimetry) and 2170 particles/μL (photothermal detection), respectively. In addition, this sensing platform has demonstrated excellent performance to well distinguish breast cancer patients from healthy individuals in serum samples analysis. Overall, the proposed dual-readout biosensor opens promising prospects for exosome detection in biological study and clinical applications.\",\n","       'Simultaneous quantification of multiple single nucleotide variants in PIK3CA ctDNA using mass-tagged LCR probe sets.Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in blood carries genetic variations associated with tumors. There is evidence indicating that the abundance of single nucleotide variant (SNV) in ctDNA is correlated well with cancer progression and metastasis. Thus, accurate and quantitative detection of SNVs in ctDNA may benefit clinical practice. However, most current methods are unsuitable for the quantification of SNV in ctDNA that usually differentiates from wild-type DNA (wtDNA) only by a single base. In this setting, ligase chain reaction (LCR) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) was developed to simultaneously quantify multiple SNVs using PIK3CA ctDNA as a model. Mass-tagged LCR probe set for each SNV including mass-tagged probe and three DNA probes was firstly designed and prepared. Then, LCR was initiated to discriminate SNVs specifically and amplify the signal of SNVs in ctDNA selectively. Afterward, a biotin-streptavidin reaction system was used to separate the amplified products, and photolysis was initiated to release mass tags. Finally, mass tags were monitored and quantified by MS. After optimizing conditions and verifying performance, this quantitative system was applied for blood samples from breast cancer patients, and risk stratification for breast cancer metastasis was also performed. This study is among the first to quantify multiple SNVs in ctDNA in a signal amplification and conversion manner, and also highlights the potential of SNV in ctDNA as a liquid biopsy marker to monitor cancer progression and metastasis.',\n","       \"Mediators of county-level racial and economic privilege in cancer screening.BACKGROUND: Area-level social determinants of health (SDoH) impact access to cancer care and prevention. Little is known about the factors that underlie the impact of residential privilege on county-level cancer screening uptake. METHODS: Population-based cross-sectional study examining county-level data was obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's PLACES database, American Community Survey and the County Health Rankings and Roadmap database. The Index of Concentration of Extremes (ICE), a validated measure of racial and economic privilege, was examined relative to county-level rates of US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guideline-concordant screening for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers. Generalized structural equation modeling was used to determine the indirect and direct effects of ICE on cancer screening uptake. RESULTS: Across 3142 counties, county-level cancer screening rates demonstrated geographical variation ranging from 54.0% to 81.8% for breast cancer screening, from 39.8% to 74.4% for colorectal cancer screening, and from 69.9% to 89.7% for cervical cancer screening. Of note, cancer screening rates for breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer all increased from lower (ICE-Q1) to higher (ICE-Q4) privileged areas (breast: Q1\\u2009=\\u200971.0% vs. Q4\\u2009=\\u200972.2%; colorectal: Q1\\u2009=\\u200959.4% vs. Q4\\u2009=\\u200965.0%; cervical: Q1\\u2009=\\u200983.3% vs. Q4\\u2009=\\u200985.2%; all p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Mediation analysis revealed that the observed disparities between ICE and cancer screening uptake were explained by mediators such as poverty status, lack of health insurance or employment, urban-rural location and access to primary care physicians that accounted for 64% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 61%-67%), 85% (95% CI: 80%-89%), and 74% (95% CI: 71%-77%) of the effect on breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer screening, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In this cross-sectional study, the association between racial and economic privilege on USPSTF-recommended cancer screening was complex and influenced by an interplay of sociodemographic, geographical, and structural factors. Understanding the underlying area-level SDoH that mediate disparities in cancer prevention strategies can help focus interventions to improve equity in cancer prevention.\",\n","       'Increasing rates of general anesthesia use in lumpectomy procedures: A 15-year trends analysis.BACKGROUND: Anesthesia methods in oncologic breast surgery have evolved with less invasive practices. The aims of this study were primarily to examine trends in anesthesia type used during lumpectomy. METHODS: We analyzed lumpectomy procedures from 2005 to 2019 using the NSQIP database. Upon defining the nadir in general anesthesia (GA) and peak in monitored anesthesia care (MAC) use as 2007, we compared patient characteristics and complications in the 2007 versus 2019 GA and MAC cohorts. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine associations with receipt of GA. RESULTS: Of 253\\u2009545 lumpectomy patients, 191\\u2009773 (75.6%) received GA and 61\\u2009772 (24.4%) received MAC. From 2005 to 2019, GA rates increased from 66.7% to 82.5%, while MAC rates decreased from 33.3% to 17.5%. More GA patients were obese and American Society of Anesthesiologists\\xa0class 3. Over time, age and body mass index\\xa0(BMI) increased in both GA and MAC cohorts. Odds of receiving GA increased over time, and predictors included concurrent axillary lymph node dissection (p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) or sentinel lymph node biopsy (p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate increasing use of GA over time for lumpectomy, which may be related to aging lumpectomy patient population with higher BMIs. We also find a strong association between use of GA and concurrent lymph node procedures.',\n","       'A new practical method of estimating tumoral microenvironment parameters of possible prognostic significance in patients with invasive breast carcinoma: Combined microenvironment score.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In recent years, the tumor microenvironment has become increasingly recognized as an influential factor in breast cancer development and growth. The parameters that form the microenvironment are the tumor stroma ratio and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. In addition, tumor budding, which shows the ability of the tumor to metastasize, gives information about the progression of the tumor. In this study, the combined microenvironment score (CMS) was determined with these parameters, and the relationship between CMS and prognostic parameters and survival was evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In our study, tumor stroma ratio, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and tumor budding were evaluated in hematoxylin-eosin sections of 419 patients with invasive ductal carcinoma. Patients were scored separately for each of these parameters, and these scores were summed to determine the CMS. The patients were divided into 3 groups according to CMS and the relationship between CMS and prognostic parameters and the survival of the patients was studied. RESULTS: The patients with CMS 3 had higher histological grade and Ki67 proliferation index compared to CMS 1 and 2. Additionally, lymphovascular invasion, axillary lymph node and distant metastasis were more common. Disease-free, and overall survival were significantly shortened in the CMS 3 group. CMS was found as an independent risk factor for DFS (HR: 2.144 (95\\xa0% CI: 1.219-3.77) p: 0.008), but not an independent risk factor for OS. CONCLUSION: CMS is a prognostic parameter that can be easily evaluated and does not require extra time and cost. Evaluating the morphological parameters of the microenvironment with a single scoring system will contribute to routine pathology practice and predict patient prognosis.',\n","       'Are the MIA and MSKCC nomograms useful in selecting patients with melanoma for sentinel lymph node biopsy?BACKGROUND AND METHODS: The Melanoma Institute of Australia (MIA) and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) nomograms were developed to help guide sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) decisions. Although statistically validated, whether these prediction models provide clinical benefit at National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline-endorsed thresholds is unknown. We conducted a net benefit analysis to quantify the clinical utility of these nomograms at risk thresholds of 5%-10% compared to the alternative strategy of biopsying all patients. External validation data for MIA and MSKCC nomograms were extracted from respective published studies. RESULTS: The MIA nomogram provided added net benefit at a risk threshold of 9% but net harm at 5%-8% and 10%. The MSKCC nomogram provided added net benefit at risk thresholds of 5% and 9%-10% but net harm at 6%-8%. When present, the magnitude of net benefit was small (1-3 net avoidable biopsies per 100 patients). CONCLUSION: Neither model consistently provided added net benefit compared to performing SLNB for all patients. DISCUSSION: Based on published data, use of the MIA or MSKCC nomograms as decision-making tools for SLNB at risk thresholds of 5%-10% does not clearly provide clinical benefit to patients.',\n","       '\"Time\" for obesity-related cancer: The role of the circadian rhythm in cancer pathogenesis and treatment.The circadian rhythm is regulated by an intrinsic time-tracking system, composed both of a central and a peripheral clock, which influences the cycles of activities and sleep of an individual over 24\\xa0h. At the molecular level, the circadian rhythm begins when two basic helix-loop-helix/Per-ARNT-SIM (bHLH-PAS) proteins, BMAL-1 and CLOCK, interact with each other to produce BMAL-1/CLOCK heterodimers in the cytoplasm. The BMAL-1/CLOCK target genes encode for the repressor components of the clock, cryptochrome (Cry1 and Cry2) and the Period proteins (Per1, Per2 and Per3). It has been recently demonstrated that the disruption of circadian rhythm is associated with an increased risk of developing obesity and obesity-related diseases. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the disruption of the circadian rhythm plays a key role in tumorigenesis. Further, an association between the circadian rhythm disruptions and an increased incidence and progression of several types of cancer (e.g., breast, prostate, colorectal and thyroid cancer) has been found. As the perturbation of circadian rhythm has adverse metabolic consequences (e.g., obesity) and at the same time tumor promoter functions, this manuscript has the aim to report how the aberrant circadian rhythms affect the development and prognosis of different types of obesity-related cancers (breast, prostate, colon rectal and thyroid cancer) focusing on both human studies and on molecular aspects.',\n","       'In situ synthesis of Cu nanoclusters/CeO(2) nanorod as aggregated induced ECL probe for triple-negative breast cancer detection.Cu nanoclusters (NCs) have attracted a lot of attention due to the excellent properties. However, the low luminescence and poor stability limited the Cu NC-based sensing research. In this work, Cu NCs were in situ synthesized on CeO(2) nanorods. On the one hand, the aggregated induced electrochemiluminescence (AIECL) of Cu NCs has been observed on the CeO(2) nanorods. On the other hand, the substrate of CeO(2) nanorods acted as catalysis, which reduced the excitation potential and further enhanced the ECL signal of Cu NCs. It was noticed that CeO(2) nanorods also greatly improved the stability of Cu NCs. The resulted high ECL signals of Cu NCs can be kept constant for several days. Furthermore, MXene nanosheets/Au NPs has been employed as electrode modification materials to construct the sensing platform to detect miRNA-585-3p in triple negative breast cancer tissues. Au NPs@MXene nanosheets not only enlarged the specific interface area of the electrodes and the number of reaction sites, but also modulated electron transfer to amplify the ECL signal of Cu NCs. The biosensor had a low detection limit (0.9\\xa0fM) and a wide linear range (1\\xa0fM to 1\\xa0μM) for the detection of miRNA-585-3p in the clinic tissues.',\n","       'The role of exercise in obesity-related cancers: Current evidence and biological mechanisms.Cancer ranks among the five leading causes of death in almost all countries and has important repercussions for individual and public health, the healthcare system, and society in general. Obesity increases the incidence of many types of cancer, but growing evidence suggests that physical activity may decrease risk for developing a variety of obesity-related cancer types, and, in some cases, may improve cancer prognosis and mortality rates. This review summarizes recent evidence on the effect of physical activity on obesity-related cancer prevention and survival. For some cancers, including breast, colorectal, and endometrial cancer, there is strong evidence for a preventative effect of exercise, but for many others, including gallbladder and kidney cancer, and multiple myeloma, evidence is inconsistent or largely lacking. Though many potential mechanisms have been proposed to explain the onco-protective effect of exercise, including improved insulin sensitivity, alterations in sex hormone availability, improved immune function and inflammation, myokine secretion, and modulation of intracellular signaling at the level of AMP kinase, the exact mechanism(s) of action within each cancer subtype remains poorly defined. Overall, a deeper understanding of how exercise can help against cancer and of the exercise parameters that can be altered to optimize exercise prescription is necessary and should be the subject of future investigation.',\n","       'Narirutin downregulates lipoxygenase-5 expression and induces G0/G1 arrest in triple-negative breast carcinoma cells.BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 20% of breast cancer that does not express HER2, progesterone and estrogen receptors. It is associated with a high mortality rate, morbidity, metastasis, recurrence, poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy. Lipoxygenase-5 (LOX-5), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), cathepsin-D (CATD), ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) are involved in breast cancer carcinogenesis; hence, there is a pressing need to identify novel chemicals that targets these enzymes. Narirutin, a flavanone glycoside abundantly present in citrus fruits, is reported to have immune-modulatory, anti-allergic and antioxidant potential. Still, the cancer chemopreventive mechanism against TNBC has not been explored. METHODS: In vitro experiments, enzyme activity, expression analysis, molecular docking and MD simulation were carried out. RESULTS: Narirutin suppressed the growth of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 in a dose-proportional manner. The pronounced effect with >50% inhibition was observed in SRB and MTT assays for MDAMB-231 cells. Unexpectedly, narirutin suppressed the proliferation of normal cells (24.51%) at 100\\xa0μM. Further, narirutin inhibits the activity of LOX-5 in cell-free (18.18\\xa0±\\xa03.93\\xa0μM) and cell-based (48.13\\xa0±\\xa07.04\\xa0μM) test systems while moderately affecting COX-2, CATD, ODC and DHFR activity. Moreover, narirutin revealed a down-regulation of LOX-5 expression with a fold change of 1.23. Besides, MD simulation experiments confirm that narirutin binding forms a stable complex with LOX-5 and improves the stability and compactness of LOX-5. In addition, the prediction analysis demonstrates that narirutin could not cross the blood-brain barrier and did not act as an inhibitor of different CYPs. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Narirutin could be a potent cancer chemopreventive lead for TNBC, further paving the way for synthesizing novel analogues.',\n","       'miRNA-1246, HOTAIR, and IL-39 signature as potential diagnostic biomarkers in breast cancer.The molecular alterations in noncoding RNA can lead to a cellular storm that is correlated to higher mortality and morbidity rates and contributes to the progression and metastasis of cancer. Herein, we aim to evaluate the expression levels and correlations of microRNA-1246 (miR-1246), HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR), and interleukin-39 (IL-39) in patients with breast cancer (BC). In this study, 130 participants were recruited, including 90 breast cancer patients and 40 healthy control participants. Serum levels of miR-1246 and HOTAIR expression were assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Also, the level of IL-39 expression was evaluated using a Western blot. All BC participants demonstrated a remarkable elevation in miR-1246 and HOTAIR expression levels. Moreover, IL-39 expression levels demonstrated a noticeable decline in BC patients. Furthermore, the differential expression fold of miR-1246 and HOTAIR revealed a strong positive correlation among breast cancer patients. In addition, a negative relationship between the IL-39 and the miR-1246 and HOTAIR differential expression was also noticed. This study revealed that HOTAIR/miR-1246 exerts an oncogenic impact in patients with breast cancer. The expression levels of circulation miR-1246, HOTAIR, and IL-39 could be considered early diagnostic biomarkers in BC patients.',\n","       'A high performance dual-mode biosensor based on Nd-MOF nanosheets functionalized with ionic liquid and gold nanoparticles for sensing of ctDNA.A dual-mode biosensor constructed based on photoelectrochemical (PEC) and electrochemical (EC) property was developed for assaying circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), which is commonly used for triple-negative breast cancer diagnosis. Ionic liquid functionalized two-dimensional Nd-MOF nanosheets were successfully synthesized through a template-assisted reagent substituting reaction. Nd-MOF nanosheets integrated with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were able to improve photocurrent response and supply active sites for assembling sensing elements. To achieve selective detection of ctDNA, thiol-functionalized capture probes (CPs) were immobilized on the Nd-MOF@AuNPs modified glassy carbon electrode surface, thereby generating a \"signal-off\" photoelectrochemical biosensor for ctDNA under visible light irradiation. After the recognition of ctDNA, ferrocene-labeled signaling probes (Fc-SPs) were introduced into the biosensing interface. After hybridization between ctDNA and Fc-SPs, the oxidation peak current of Fc-SPs generated from square wave voltammetry can be employed as a \"signal-on\" electrochemical signal for ctDNA quantification. Under the optimized conditions, a linear relationship was obtained to the logarithm of ctDNA concentration in between 1.0\\xa0fmol\\xa0L(-1) to 10\\xa0nmol\\xa0L(-1) for the PEC model and 1.0\\xa0fmol\\xa0L(-1) to 1.0\\xa0nmol\\xa0L(-1) for the EC model. The dual-mode biosensor can provide accurate results for ctDNA assays, effectively eliminating the probable occurrence of false-positive or false-negative results in single-model assays. By switching DNA probe sequences, the proposed dual-mode biosensing platform can serve as a strategy for detecting other DNAs and possesses broad applications in bioassay and early disease diagnosis.',\n","       \"Breast Cancer in Two Ex-Votos, A Millennia Apart: Patients' Hope and Faith Expressed Through the Centuries in Votive Offerings.A\\xa0votive offering or ex-voto includes a variety of usually non-professional artworks offered to divinities and placed in religious sites to fulfill a vow or in gratitude for recovery from an illness or injury.

Molecular docking and virtual screening were effectively and systematically used to identify specific targets in malignant tumors and screen potential drugs. Here, we screen perfect leading compounds from a medicate library (ZINC15 database) and analyze their properties (conveyance, absorption, metabolism, excretion, and harmless forecasts) with potential inhibition of Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog (KRAS) G12C. Further results demonstrated that ZINC000013817014 and ZINC000004098458 were screened out from the ZINC15 database and were identified to have a much better binding affinity and more favorable interaction vitality binding with KRAS G12C and less rat carcinogenicity, Ames mutagenicity, way better dissolvability in water and noninhibition with cytochrome P-450 2D6. Molecular dynamics simulation analysis indicated that the binding capacity of these two compounds and KRAS G12C, ZINC000013817014-KRAS G12C, and ZINC000004098458-KRAS G12C is stable in the natural environment. Our findings reveal that ZINC000013817014 and ZINC000004098458 were perfect leading compounds to be inhibitors binding with KRAS G12C, which were selected as safe drug candidates and a cornerstone for KRAS G12C-related medicine plan and improvement.

In this study, we investigated the clinical factors and prognosis of HER2-low breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). METHODS: Data from patients diagnosed with HER2-zero or HER2-low breast cancer at a single center between January 2017 and December 2021 who underwent NAC followed by surgery were retrospectively reviewed. HER2 status was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH), and classified as HER2-zero (IHC 0), HER2-low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+ and FISH-), and HER2-positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+ and FISH+). Baseline characteristics were analyzed and compared between the HER2-low and HER2-zero groups. Survival outcomes were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test and Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis. RESULTS: The sample comprised 132 patients with HER2-zero [n\\xa0=\\xa062 (47.0\\xa0%)] and HER2-low [n\\xa0=\\xa070 (53.0\\xa0%)] breast cancer. Relative to the HER2-zero group, the HER2-low group contained larger proportions of patients with hormone receptor (HR) positivity (37.1\\xa0% vs. 75.7\\xa0%, P\\xa0<\\xa00.001) and low nuclear grades and Ki-67 indices (both P\\xa0<\\xa00.05).

At the final follow-up [median 20 (range 4-66) months], patients with HER2-low status had significantly favorable disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) outcomes relative to those with HER2-zero status (87.1\\xa0% vs. 71.0\\xa0%, P\\xa0=\\xa00.02 and 94.3\\xa0% vs. 82.3\\xa0%, P\\xa0=\\xa00.02, respectively). HER2-low status and pCR were independent prognostic factors for DFS [hazard ratio (HR)\\xa0=\\xa00.31, 95\\xa0% confidence interval (CI) 0.13-0.75, P\\xa0=\\xa00.009 and HR\\xa0=\\xa00.08, 95\\xa0% CI 0.01-0.67, P\\xa0=\\xa00.02, respectively]. CONCLUSION: This analysis revealed that HER2-low status is associated significantly with HR positivity and low nuclear grades, Ki-67 indices, and pCR rate. It is also associated with favorable DFS and OS outcomes after NAC. HER2-low status and pCR are independent prognostic factors for DFS.',\n","       'Urothelial carcinoma metastases impacting the CNS: A 20-year retrospective series.INTRODUCTION: Our group has a longstanding interest in metastases impacting the central nervous system (CNS), including spread from prostatic adenocarcinomas, thyroid carcinomas, and breast carcinomas, most of which metastasize to CNS sites at a later time after the primary tumor is well-known. However, one of the least frequent types of systemic malignancies to metastasize to brain or spine is urothelial carcinoma. Thus, few large studies from a single institution exist. Fewer still detail the interval between first diagnosis of primary tumor and CNS lesion, or whether a patient might have their first presentation of cancer in the brain or spine, thus prompting review of our 20-year experience. MATERIALS: Case identification via text word search of pathology databases from our adult and referral hospitals, 2002 to present. Demographic and clinical data were extracted from reports and the medical record. RESULTS: 15 cases, 11 male: 4 female, age range 37-82\\xa0years were identified. Nine had metastases to brain parenchyma, 5 to vertebral column impacting spinal cord, and 2 to skull, one of which had tumor extension into right parietal lobe. Strikingly, 5 of 15 patients had had their CNS-impacting metastasis as their first presentation of neoplastic disease. CONCLUSIONS: CNS metastasis of urothelial carcinoma is a rare occurrence; nevertheless, pathologists should include urothelial carcinoma in their differential diagnosis as a type of cancer that can first present with a CNS-impacting metastasis.',\n","       'Outcomes of single brain metastasis treated with gamma knife stereotaxic radiosurgery(GKSR). Our experience on 103 cases.BACKGROUND: Brain metastases (BM) occur in the natural course of malignant tumors in 18-40% of cases. Their management has changed considerably over the past decade thanks to the advent of Gamma knife Stereotactic Radiosurgery (GKSR). OBJECTIVE: We report our experience on Single Brain metastasis treated with (GKSR). METHODS: Patients treated by Gamma Knife stereotaxic radiosurgery (GKSR) in our institution between 2009 and 2021 for Single BM were recorded retrospectively. RESULTS: A total of 103 patients (n\\xa0=\\xa052; 50.5% females) were included, with a mean age of 56.33\\xa0±\\xa011.33. Breast (n\\xa0=\\xa039, 37.9%) and lung (n\\xa0=\\xa036, 35%) were the common original location for the primary tumors. GKSR alone without prior surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy was achieved in 81.5% (n\\xa0=\\xa084). Thirteen patients (15.1%) progressed in BM volume while finding the appearance of de novo BM in 5 (5.8%) patients. The median percentage of tumor control after radiosurgery treatment was 70% (IQR: 65-78) and only 26.2% (n\\xa0=\\xa027) of patients had >\\xa080% tumor control and stability over the median follow-up time of 5 (95% CI, 4-6) months. We found only two cases of radionecrosis (1.9%). The median survival time was 5.21 (IQR, 3-8) months. Retreatment, recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) class, and tumor stability influenced the overall survival of BM respectively (Hazard Ratio adjust (HRa)=\\xa05.610,p\\xa0=\\xa00.045; HRa=\\xa06.133,p\\xa0=\\xa00.031; HRa=\\xa022.463, p\\xa0=\\xa00.036). CONCLUSION: Stereotaxic Radiosurgery provides good results in terms of Overall survival with fewer neurocognitive disorders.RPA class and tumor control (stability) influenced the overall survival of single BM.',\n","       'Anticancer activity of retinoic acid against breast cancer cells derived from an Iraqi patient.OBJECTIVE: Breast cancer is one of the most lethal diseases in women, both worldwide and in Iraq. The high mortality rate is attributed primarily to the chemoresistance to conventional therapeutics. The search for effective and safe treatments is critical. One promising agent that has shown activity against various cancer types is retinoic acid (RA). METHODS: RA was tested against a panel of international breast cancer cell lines and compared with Iraqi patient-derived hormone-independent breast cancer cells through MTT viability assays. Cytopathology was assessed under an inverted microscope, and apoptotic induction was evaluated with acridine orange propidium iodide assays. RESULTS: AMJ13 breast cancer cells were more sensitive to killing induced by RA than MCF-7 and CAL-51\\xa0cells. By contrast, normal HBL-100\\xa0cells showed a negligible effect. Cytological changes were observed in all cancer cells treated with RA, whereas no changes were observed in normal HBL-100\\xa0cells. Iraqi patient-derived breast cancer cells showed a higher percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis after RA treatment than the other breast cancer cells. CONCLUSION: We suggest RA as a possible breast cancer treatment with potential for clinical application with high safety.',\n","       'Elevated expression of myosin VI contributes to breast cancer progression via MAPK/ERK signaling pathway.Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common malignancies occurring in women worldwide, and its incidence is increasing each year. Accumulating evidence indicated that Myosin VI (MYO6) functions as a gene associated with tumor progression in several cancers. However, the potential role of MYO6 and its underlying mechanisms in the development and progression of BC remains unknown. Herein, we examined the expression levels of MYO6 in BC cells and tissues by western blot and immunohistochemistry. Loss- and gain-of-function investigations in vitro were performed to determine the biological functions of MYO6. And in vivo effects of MYO6 on tumorigenesis were investigated in nude mice. Our findings showed that the expression of MYO6 was up-regulated in breast cancer, and its high expression was correlated with poor prognosis. Further investigation exhibited that silencing the expression of MYO6 significantly inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion, whereas overexpression of MYO6 enhanced these abilities in vitro. Also, reduced expression of MYO6 significantly retarded the tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) revealed that MYO6 was involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Moreover, we proved that MYO6 enhanced BC proliferation, migration and invasion via increasing the expression of phosphorylated ERK1/2. Taken together, our findings highlight the role of MYO6 in promoting BC cell progression through MAPK/ERK pathway, suggesting it may be a new potential therapeutic and prognostic target for BC patients.',\n","       'Predicting gene mutation status via artificial intelligence technologies based on multimodal integration (MMI) to advance precision oncology.Personalized treatment strategies for cancer frequently rely on the detection of genetic alterations which are determined by molecular biology assays. Historically, these processes typically required single-gene sequencing, next-generation sequencing, or visual inspection of histopathology slides by experienced pathologists in a clinical context. In the past decade, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have demonstrated remarkable potential in assisting physicians with accurate diagnosis of oncology image-recognition tasks. Meanwhile, AI techniques make it possible to integrate multimodal data such as radiology, histology, and genomics, providing critical guidance for the stratification of patients in the context of precision therapy. Given that the mutation detection is unaffordable and time-consuming for a considerable number of patients, predicting gene mutations based on routine clinical radiological scans or whole-slide images of tissue with AI-based methods has become a hot issue in actual clinical practice. In this review, we synthesized the general framework of multimodal integration (MMI) for molecular intelligent diagnostics beyond standard techniques. Then we summarized the emerging applications of AI in the prediction of mutational and molecular profiles of common cancers (lung, brain, breast, and other tumor types) pertaining to radiology and histology imaging. Furthermore, we concluded that there truly exist multiple challenges of AI techniques in the way of its real-world application in the medical field, including data curation, feature fusion, model interpretability, and practice regulations. Despite these challenges, we still prospect the clinical implementation of AI as a highly potential decision-support tool to aid oncologists in future cancer treatment management.',\n","       'Nanomedicine in therapeutic warfront against estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in women worldwide. Almost 70-80% of cases of BC are curable at the early non-metastatic stage. BC is a heterogeneous disease with different molecular subtypes. Around 70% of breast tumors exhibit estrogen-receptor (ER) expression and endocrine therapy is used for the treatment of these patients. However, there are high chances of recurrence in the endocrine therapy regimen. Though chemotherapy and radiation therapy have substantially improved survival rates and treatment outcomes in BC patients, there is an increased possibility of the development of resistance and dose-limiting toxicities. Conventional treatment approaches often suffer from low bioavailability, adverse effects due to the non-specific action of chemotherapeutics, and low antitumor efficacy. Nanomedicine has emerged as a conspicuous strategy for delivering anticancer therapeutics in BC management. It has revolutionized the area of cancer therapy by increasing the bioavailability of the therapeutics and improving their anticancer efficacy with reduced toxicities on healthy tissues. In this article, we have highlighted various mechanisms and pathways involved in the progression of ER-positive BC. Further, different nanocarriers delivering drugs, genes, and natural therapeutic agents for surmounting BC are the spotlights of this article.',\n","       \"Melanoma stem cell vaccine induces effective tumor immunity against melanoma.Melanoma stem cells (MSCs)-based vaccine strategies have been a potent immunotherapeutic approach for melanoma treatment, which aimed at inducing specific anti-tumor immunity and targeting cancer stem-like cells. As the main cancer-fighting immune cells, CD8(+)T cells play an important role in vaccine-induced antitumor immunity. Here, we developed a novel MSC vaccine that induces CD8(+)T cells to target melanoma stem cells specifically. The MSC vaccine was prepared for our study in order to determine the effectiveness of antitumor immunity. The proportion and activity of CD8(+)T cells were examined in the spleen after immunization, in particular, the expression and cytotoxicity of the immune checkpoint of spleen lymphocytes were detected by flow cytometry and ELISA, moreover, tumor size and the number of lung metastasis nodules were observed and the specific killing effect of the vaccine was evaluated in immunized mice. We found that the MSC vaccine could promote DCs maturation, activate CD8(+)T cells, suppress the expression of CTLA-4, PD-1, and Tim-3, and increase the expression of IFN-γ and GzmB of CD8(+)T cells. Melanoma growth and metastasis were inhibited by the vaccine's specific targeted killing effect. The vaccines based on melanoma stem cells (MSCs) delay the progression of melanoma by inducing anti-tumor immune responses in CD8(+)T cells.\",\n","       'Ras interacting protein 1 facilitated proliferation and invasion of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cells.A GTPase binding protein, Ras interacting protein 1 (RASIP1), has been reported with a tumor-promoting role in lung cancer cells, and its role in lymphoma remains unknown. The analysis of medical databank shows that RASIP1 is upregulated in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) specimens. In this article, we demonstrated that RASIP1 is highly expressed in DLBCL cell lines, compared with primary B cells. The gain- and loss-of-function experiments were performed to investigate the effects of RASIP1 on DLBCL cells. CCK-8, flow cytometry, western blot, and transwell assays demonstrated that silence of RASIP1 inhibited proliferation, cell cycle transition, and invasion and induced significant apoptosis in DLBCL cells, and ectopic expression of RASIP1 played opposite roles. Xenograft results revealed that RASIP1 facilitated the growth of DLBCL cells in vivo. These findings suggest that RASIP1 may be required for malignancy of DLBCL cells. In addition, we also found that the expression of RASIP1 was negatively regulated by forkhead box O3 (FOXO3), which has been reported to suppress the proliferation of DLBCL cells. Our results indicate that FOXO3 is bound to the promoter sequence of RASIP1 and inhibits its transcription. The suppressive effects of FOXO3 on proliferation and invasion of DLBCL cells were neutralized by RASIP1. In conclusion, we demonstrate that FOXO3 negatively regulated RASIP1 facilitates growth and invasion of DLBCL cells, provides novel diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for DLBCL in clinic.',\n","       'Knockdown of LINC00511 enhances radiosensitivity of lung adenocarcinoma via regulating miR-497-5p/SMAD3.As the most common histological subtype of primary lung cancer, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) causes enormous cancer deaths worldwide. Radiotherapy has been frequently used in LUAD cases, and radiosensitivity is vital for LUAD therapy. This research sought to explore the genetic factors affecting radiosensitivity in LUAD and inner mechanisms. LINC00511, miR-497-5p, and SMAD3 expression in LUAD cells were detected via qRT-PCR and western blot. CCK-8 assays, colony formation, and flow cytometry assays were employed to explore the cell viability, apoptosis, and radiosensitivity in PC-9 and A549 cells. The targeting relationship between LINC00511, miR-497-5p, and SMAD3 was verified by dual luciferase reporter assay. Furthermore, xenograft experiments were performed for the in vivo verification. In conclusion, LINC00511 was overexpressed in LUAD cells, which downregulated downstream miR-497-5p expression and mediately led to SMAD3 activation. LINC00511 downregulation suppressed cell viability while enhanced apoptosis rate in LUAD cells. Also, LINC00511 and SMAD3 were overexpressed, while miR-497-5p was downregulated in LUAD cells exposed to 4Gy irradiation treatment. Moreover, LINC00511 inhibition could block SMAD3 expression and promoted the radiosensitivity both in vitro and in vivo. These findings uncover LINC00511 knockdown promoted miR-497-5p expression and subsequently led to lower SMAD3 level, which enhanced radiosensitivity in LUAD cells. LINC00511/miR-497-5p/SMAD3 axis could be of considerable potential to enhance radiosensitivity in LUAD.',\n","       'Immune checkpoint inhibitors as first-line therapy for non-small cell lung cancer: A systematic evaluation and meta-analysis.Recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) present promising application prospects in treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study aimed to investigate optimal treatment strategy by comparing the first-line treatment strategies with ICIs in NSCLC. We retrieved relevant studies on first-line therapy of NSCLC with ICIs. Primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary outcomes were treatment-related serious adverse events (tr-SAEs) with grade 3 or higher and objective response rate (ORR). We also conducted a Bayesian network meta-analysis. We included 14 studies involving 7,823 patients and compared seven different interventions. In PD-L1 nonselective NSCLC, nivolumab+ipilimumab had good PFS and ORR, pembrolizumab significantly prolonged OS, and nivolumab had the fewest adverse events (AEs). For PD-L1-positive patients, nivolumab remarkably prolonged OS. For those with negative PD-L1, nivolumab+ipilimumab also showed an advantage. In addition, nivolumab+ipilimumab significantly prolonged the PFS in both PD-L1-negative and -positive patients. For patients with PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) within 1-49%, atezolizumab+chemotherapy remarkably prolonged PFS and OS. For those with PD-L1 TPS ≥50%, pembrolizumab prolonged OS and atezolizumab+chemotherapy significantly prolonged PFS. Nivolumab combined with ipilimumab showed advantages in OS, PFS and ORR in most patients. Nivolumab+ipilimumab may be the optimal first-line therapy for NSCLC.',\n","       'Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine and thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives as novel EGFR(L858R/T790M) inhibitors.EGFR mutations have been identified in 20,000 reported NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer) samples, and exon 19 deletions and L858R mutations at position 21, known as \"classical\" mutations, account for 85-90% of the total EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) mutations. In this paper, two series of EGFR kinase inhibitors were designed and synthesised. Among them, compound B1 showed an IC(50) value of 13\\u2009nM for kinase inhibitory activity against EGFR(L858R/T790M) and more than 76-fold selectivity for EGFR(WT). Furthermore, in an in\\xa0vitro anti-tumour activity test, compound B1 showed an effective anti-proliferation activity against H1975 cells with an IC(50) value of 0.087 μΜ. We also verified the mechanism of action of compound B1 as a selective inhibitor of EGFR(L858R/T790M) by cell migration assay and apoptosis assay.',\n","       'Construction of inflammatory associated risk gene prognostic model of NSCLC and its correlation with chemotherapy sensitivity.BACKGROUND: Inflammation is an important pathogenic factor of most malignant tumors. It is essential to understand mechanism underlying inflammation and cancer development, so as to formulate and develop anti-cancer treatment strategies. However, inflammatory-related gene characterization as well as risk model construction in prognosis and response chemotherapy or immunotherapy in NSCLC are still remain unclear. METHODS: A total of 1014 lung cancer samples with RNA-seqencing results were download from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The patient cohort was randomized as a training and test cohorts, and 200 inflammatory-related genes were selected based on previously published data. Consensus clustering and Enrichment and immune function analyses base on Differential expression genes (DEGs) were performed. Prognosis Prediction Model were Constructed and Chemotherapy and immunotherapy sensitivity base on this model were performed. At last, H1299 and HCC827 cells were used to tested the mitoxantrone and oxal iplatin sensitivity after KRT6A knockdown. RESULTS: We identified the inflammatory-related genes from NSCLC datasets to build one prognosis prediction signature based on cluster inflammatory-related genes to lay a certain foundation for distinguishing high-risk NSCLC cases with dismal prognostic outcome. The nomogram provides the AUC values for 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival were 0.831, 0.853, and 0.86 in validation cohort. Morover, different sensitivity of immunotherapy or chemotherapy also were classified base on the different risk groups in NSCLC patients, which provided potent clinical reference. At last, targeting KRT6A sensitive to mitoxantrone and oxaliplatin in H1299 and HCC827 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory-related gene risk-score is the potential chemotherapeutic and immunotherapeutic biomarker for NSCLC, and targeting KRT6A sensitive to mitoxantrone and oxaliplatin in NSCLC.HighlightsInflammatory-related genes can lay a certain foundation for distinguishing high-risk NSCLC cases with dismal prognostic outcome.Risk-score base on inflammatory-related genes is positive correlated with CD274, TGFBR1 and TGFB1 expression.Targeting KRT6A sensitive to mitoxantrone and oxaliplatin in H1299 and HCC827 cells.',\n","       'The Prognostic Nutritional Index before durvalumab after chemoradiation predict the overall survival in patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: Adjuvant durvalumab after chemoradiation has become the standard of care for patients with stage III NSCLC, according to the PACIFIC trial. Whether biomarkers before durvalumab for patients with stage III NSCLC showed predictive and prognostic effects remains unknown. METHODS: This is a retrospective study in the Fujieda Municipal General Hospital between October 2018 and March 2022. We assessed the predictive value of the Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI) in stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with durvalumab after chemoradiation. RESULTS: After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the study included 56 patients for further analysis. The median follow-up period was 17.6\\u2009months (range, 3.0-45.4\\u2009months). According to receiver operating characteristic curve results, the PNI cutoff value to predict overall survival (OS) was 37.9, with sensitivity and specificity at 67.9% and 67.9%. Accordingly, the patients were divided into low- and high-PNI groups. Patients with the low-PNI group had a significantly shorter progression-free survival compared to the high-PNI group (median, 9.1 vs. 21.3\\u2009months, p\\u2009=\\u20090.032). OS was also shorter in the low-PNI group (median, 19.0 months vs. not reached, p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). In the multivariate Cox hazards regression analyses, the high-PNI was an independent prognostic factor for OS (hazard ratio, 0.187; 95% confidence interval, 0.046-0.760; p\\u2009=\\u20090.019). It seems that PNI could be used as a predictor for OS in patients with stage III NSCLC treated with durvalumab after chemoradiation.KEY MESSAGESInadequate immunocompetence and nutritional status after chemoradiation therapy may result in poor antitumor efficacy of ICIs.Pretreatment immune and nutritional assessment using PNI could be considered an independent predictor for the survival of stage III NSCLC patients treated with durvalumab after chemoradiation therapy.',\n","       'Triple targeting of mutant EGFR(L858R/T790M), COX-2, and 15-LOX: design and synthesis of novel quinazolinone tethered phenyl urea derivatives for anti-inflammatory and anticancer evaluation.We designed and synthesised novel quinazolinone tethered phenyl urea derivatives (6a-p) that triple target the double mutant EGFR(L858R/T790M), COX-2, and 15-LOX. Compounds (6e, 6d, 6j, 6m, and 6n) not only had low micromolar IC50 inhibitory activities against the three targets, but they also showed good selectivity for COX-2 over COX-1 and for EGFR(L858R/T790M) over wild-type EGFR. Except for 6e and 6n, all of the tested compounds inhibited the NO production significantly more potently than celecoxib, diclofenac, and indomethacin. Compounds 6i and 6k reduced ROS levels more effectively than celecoxib and diclofenac. In terms of inhibiting TNF-α production, 6o-treated cells showed TNF-α level, which is ∼10 times lower than celecoxib. Furthermore, 6e and 6j had the highest anticancer activity against the breast cancer cell line BT-459 with growth inhibition percentages of 67.14 and 70.07%, respectively. Docking studies confirm their favoured binding affinity. The proposed compounds could be promising multi-targeted leads.',\n","       'Research progress and value of albumin-related inflammatory markers in the prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer: a review of clinical evidence.Inflammatory markers have a wide range of predictive values in the prognosis of non-small lung cancer (NSCLC). Poor nutritional status usually means a poor prognosis in patients with NSCLC, which is widely recognized by oncologists and nutritionists. Serum albumin has a certain value in evaluating the prognosis of patients. Several inflammatory albumin-related markers have been proposed, but they have not been widely used in predicting the prognosis of NSCLC in clinical practice. We aim to systematically review the published clinical evidence of albumin-related inflammatory markers in predicting the prognosis of NSCLC and to describe their progress and value. The results showed that the markers included in the review could be prognostic indicators in patients with NSCLC. However, we found that the cut-off value of albumin-related inflammatory markers with quantitative nature was very chaotic and needed to be defined by recognized standards. We summarized and compared the advantages and disadvantages of these markers, but a prospective cohort study with long-term follow-up after adjustment for important confounders is still necessary. Whether the results and conclusions could be directly applied in clinical practice needs to be identified and evaluated. There is an urgent need to classify and standardize the albumin-related inflammatory markers that play an important role in the prognosis of NSCLC, which is the key to ensuring the transformation from clinical study to clinical application.',\n","       \"Recent research advances on simulation modeling of temperature distribution in microwave ablation of lung tumors.Lung tumor is the first malignant tumor with the highest mortality, but only no more than one-third of patients can be treated by surgical resection. Microwave ablation (MWA) has become a new adjuvant therapeutic mean for lung tumors because of its low trauma, short treatment time, large ablation volume and wide application range. However, the treatment parameters of MWA, such as input power and ablation time, still depend on the doctors' experience, which leads to the ineffectiveness of MWA. Therefore, the accurate modeling of temperature distribution of lung tumor MWA has become a significant technical problem to be solved. Recent research was devoted to personalized characterization of lung tumor parameters, finite element analysis of temperature distribution in MWA and accurate ablation effect evaluation.

Several prospective studies have shown a relationship between hyperthyroidism and cancer incidence; however, since the association between thyroid hormone levels and lung cancer remains controversial, this study aimed to determine the correlation between the same. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 289 patients, who were diagnosed with lung cancer at the Huzhou Central Hospital between January 2016 and January 2021, and 238 healthy subjects. The baseline clinical data of two groups were collected. The concentrations of thyroid hormones, tumor CEA, CYF, SCC, and NSE in both the lung cancer patient and healthy volunteer groups were analyzed. Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney test was used to compare continuous variables. A chi-square test was adopted to estimate the relationship between serum thyroid hormones level and clinical characteristics of lung cancer cases. ROC curve analyses were used to determine the characteristics of thyroid hormones for recognizing lung cancer. RESULTS: The results showed that serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), total thyroxine, total triiodothyronine, and free triiodothyronine (FT3) levels were significantly decreased, while free thyroxine (FT4) levels were increased in patients with lung cancer. In addition, FT3 was identified as a potential diagnostic biomarker of stage I-IV lung cancer with the area under the curve values of 0.807. What's more, FT3 and FT4 were used in combination with CEA and were identified as potential diagnostic biomarkers of stage 0 lung cancer (Tis) with the area under the curve values of 0.774.

We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database to screen patients diagnosed with cervical cancer from 2010 to 2014. The chi-squared test was used to analyse the differences in clinical characteristics, and we used Kaplan-Meier methods to perform survival analysis. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate prognostic factors, and we developed a visual nomogram to judge the prognosis. We found that lung metastasis was the most common in cervical cancer patients with distant organ metastasis. Age, race, characteristics of the tumour, and therapy should be considered when analysing the prognosis of cervical cancer patients. The findings of this study may help clinicians to formulate individualised treatment strategies.Impact StatementWhat is already known on this subject? Distant organ metastasis of cervical cancer mainly involves lung, bone, liver and brain. Once it occurs, the survival and prognosis will be threatened seriously.What the results of this study add? 4176 patients were included, and lung metastasis was the most common in cervical cancer with distant organ metastasis (3.5%). Additionally, age, race, tumour grade, histological type, T-stage, N-stage, lung, liver and bone metastasis and the treatment mode are significantly related to the outcomes of cervical cancer patients. Furthermore, we developed a nomogram that could predict the probability of three-year and five-year OS.What the implications are of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? The findings of this study may drive more and more studies focussing on the comprehensive prognostic assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of distant metastasis of cervical cancer. Besides, clinicians can utilise these findings to formulate individualised treatment strategies.',\n","       'Effectiveness of ALK inhibitors in treatment of CNS metastases in NSCLC patients.Metastases to the central nervous system (CNS) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer constitute an extremely difficult clinical problem, and their occurrence is associated with a poor prognosis. Due to the existence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the action of proteins responsible for the transport of drugs, e.g. P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the penetration of drugs into the CNS is insufficient. Until recently, the only method of CNS metastases treatment was radiotherapy and neurosurgery. The advancement of molecular biology allowed discover targets for molecularly targeted therapies. One of targets is abnormal anaplastic lymphoma kinase, which results from the rearrangement of the ALK gene in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). ALK rearrangement occurs in only about 4.5% of NSCLC patients, but its presence favors brain metastases. The ALK inhibitors (ALKi) were modified to obtain molecules with high ability to penetrate into the CNS. This was achieved by modifying the structure of individual molecules, which became, inter alia, less substrates for P-gp. These modifications caused that less than 10% of patients experience progression in CNS during new ALK inhibitors treatment. This review summarizes the knowledge about the action of BBB, the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of ALKi, with particular emphasis on their ability to penetrate the CNS and the intracranial activity of individual drugs from different generations of ALK inhibitors.',\n","       'COL28 promotes proliferation, migration, and EMT of renal tubular epithelial cells.Type XXVIII collagen (COL28) is involved in cancer and lung fibrosis. COL28 polymorphisms and mutations might be involved in kidney fibrosis, but the exact role of COL28 in renal fibrosis is unknown. This study explored the function of COL28 in renal tubular cells by examining the expression of COL28 mRNA and the effects of COL28 overexpression in human tubular cells. COL28 mRNA expression and localization were observed in normal and fibrotic kidney tissues from humans and mice using real-time PCR, western blot, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry. The consequences of COL28 overexpression on cell proliferation, migration, cell polarity, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induced by TGF-β1 were examined in human tubular HK-2 cells. COL28 expression was low in human normal renal tissues, mainly observed in the renal tubular epithelial cells and especially in proximal renal tubules. COL28 protein expression in human and mouse obstructive kidney disease was higher than in normal tissues (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05) and more significant in the UUO2-Week than the UUO1-Week group. The overexpression of COL28 promoted HK-2 cell proliferation and enhanced their migration ability (all p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). TGF-β1 (10\\u2009ng/ml) induced COL28 mRNA expression in HK-2 cells, decreased E-cadherin and increased α-SMA in the COL28-overexpression group compared with controls (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). ZO-1 expression decreased while COL6 increased in the COL28-overexpression group compared with controls (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). In conclusion, COL28 overexpression promotes the migration and proliferation of renal tubular epithelial cells. The EMT could also be involved. COL28 could be a therapeutic target against renal- fibrotic diseases.',\n","       'Evaluation of the relationship of the T and M stage with the erector spinae muscle area in male lung cancer patients.OBJECTIVES: Sarcopenia is very common due to cachexia and presents with a decrease in skeletal muscle mass. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between the T, M category and the erector spinae muscle area (ESMa). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The initial first thorax and high-resolution computed tomography (CT) of patients with lung cancer between 2015 and 2019 were retrospectively screened. After exclusion criterias remaining 226 male patients constituted the study group. ESMa was measured manually in the section taken from the T12 vertebra spinous process level as previously described in the literature and its relationship with the T and M stage were evaluated. RESULTS: The mean ages of patients were 70\\u2009±\\u20099.57\\u2009years. The T stage was T1 in 34 (15%) patients, T2 in 46 (20.4%), T3 in 59 (26.1%), and T4 in 87 (38.5%). Metastasis was detected in 83 (36.7%) patients. The mean ESMa of the patients was 34.15\\u2009±\\u20097.21\\u2009mm(2) and did not differ according to the T stage (p\\u2009=\\u2009.39). ESMa was lower in the metastatic group (mean 30.42\\u2009±\\u20096.38\\u2009mm(2)) than the non-metastatic group (mean 36.32\\u2009±\\u20096.78\\u2009mm(2)) (p\\u2009=\\u2009.0001). CONCLUSIONS: ESMa, one of the indicators of sarcopenia, is lower in patients with metastatic lung cancer than in nonmetastatic.',\n","       'A novel nomogram for predicting the decision to delayed extubation after thoracoscopic lung cancer surgery.OBJECTIVE: Delayed extubation was commonly associated with increased adverse outcomes. This study aimed to explore the incidence and predictors and to construct a nomogram for delayed extubation after thoracoscopic lung cancer surgery. METHODS: We reviewed medical records of 8716 consecutive patients undergoing this surgical treatment from January 2016 to December 2017. Using potential predictors to develop a nomogram and using a bootstrap-resampling approach to conduct internal validation. For external validation, we additionally pooled 3676 consecutive patients who underwent this procedure between January 2018 and June 2018. Extubation performed outside the operating room was defined as delayed extubation. RESULTS: The rate of delayed extubation was 1.60%. Multivariate analysis identified age, BMI, FEV(1)/FVC, lymph nodes calcification, thoracic paravertebral blockade (TPVB) usage, intraoperative transfusion, operative time and operation later than 6 p.m. as independent predictors for delayed extubation. Using these eight candidates to develop a nomogram, with a concordance statistic (C-statistic) value of 0.798 and good calibration. After internal validation, similarly good calibration and discrimination (C-statistic, 0.789; 95%CI, 0.748 to 0.830) were observed. The decision curve analysis (DCA) indicated the positive net benefit with the threshold risk range of 0 to 30%. Goodness-of-fit test and discrimination in the external validation were 0.113 and 0.785, respectively. CONCLUSION: The proposed nomogram can reliably identify patients at high risk for the decision to delayed extubation after thoracoscopic lung cancer surgery. Optimizing four modifiable factors including BMI, FEV(1)/FVC, TPVB usage, and operation later than 6 p.m. may reduce the risk of delayed extubation.Key Messages:This study identified eight independent predictors for delayed extubation, among which lymph node calcification and anaesthesia type were not commonly reported.Using these eight candidates to develop a nomogram, we could reliably identify high-risk patients for the decision to delayed extubation.Optimizing four modifiable factors, including BMI, FEV(1)/FVC, TPVB usage, and operation later than 6 p.m. may reduce the risk of delayed extubation.',\n","       \"CircDHRS3 inhibits prostate cancer cell proliferation and metastasis through the circDHRS3/miR-421/MEIS2 axis.Prostate cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer among men worldwide. The importance of circular RNA (circRNA) in prostate cancer and its connection to malignancy has been steadily recognized. circRNA expression was obtained by circRNA sequencing of prostate cancer. circRNA and its function were further analysed. The results were verified by qRT-PCR, RIP assay, FISH, RNA pulldown, WB, CCK-8, colony formation assay and wound-healing assay. BALB/c Nude mice were used for xenograft hosts. Low expression of circDHRS3 was assessed in prostate cancer. Overexpression of circDHRS3 inhibited prostate cancer growth and migration in vitro. Additionally, miR-421 was shown to be the downstream target of circDHRS3, as shown by fluorescence in situ hybridization and dual-luciferase experiments. The rescue assay results for the PC3 and Du145 cell lines demonstrated that circDHRS3 inhibits prostate cancer cell lines' ability to proliferate and metastasize by modulating MEIS2 expression through the circDHRS3/miR-421/MEIS2 axis. In vivo investigations confirmed that the overexpression of circDHRS3 could inhibit both the lung and bone metastasis of prostate cancer cells. circDHRS3 has the potential to become a biomarker and a targeted therapeutic site for prostate cancer, particularly in the malignant stage. Our study indicates that circDHRS3 inhibits prostate cancer cell proliferation and metastasis through the circDHRS3/miR-421/MEIS2 axis.\",\n","       'Baicalein attenuates bleomycin-induced lung fibroblast senescence and lung fibrosis through restoration of Sirt3 expression.CONTEXT: Fibroblast senescence was reported to contribute to the pathological development of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and baicalein is reported to attenuate IPF. OBJECTIVE: This study explores whether baicalein attenuates lung fibrosis by regulating lung fibroblast senescence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice were randomly assigned to control, bleomycin (BLM), baicalein and BLM\\u2009+\\u2009baicalein groups. Lung fibrosis was established by a single intratracheal dose of BLM (3\\u2009mg/kg). The baicalein group received baicalein orally (100\\u2009mg/kg/day). Sirtuin 3 (Sirt3) siRNA (50\\u2009μg) was injected through the tail vein once a week for 2\\xa0weeks to explore its effect on the anti-pulmonary fibrosis of baicalein. RESULTS: BLM-treated mice exhibited obvious lung fibrosis and fibroblast senescence by showing increased levels of collagen deposition (27.29% vs. 4.14%), hydroxyproline (208.05 vs. 40.16\\u2009ng/mg), collagen I (25.18 vs. 9.15\\u2009μg/mg), p53, p21, p16, MCP-1, PAI-1, TNF-α, MMP-10 and MMP-12 in lung tissues, which were attenuated by baicalein. Baicalein also mitigated BLM-mediated activation of TGF-β1/Smad signalling pathway. Baicalein restored the BLM-induced downregulation of Sirt3 expression in lung tissues and silencing of Sirt3 abolished the inhibitory role of baicalein against BLM-induced lung fibrosis, fibroblast senescence and activation of TGF-β1/Smad signalling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Baicalein preserved the BLM-induced downregulation of lung Sirt3 expression, and thus the suppression of TGF-β1/Smad signalling pathway and lung fibrosis, which might provide an experimental basis for treatment of IPF.',\n","       'Targeted next-generation sequencing for the detection of cancer-associated somatic mutations in adenomyosis.Adenomyosis is a condition characterised by the invasion of endometrial tissues into the uterine myometrium, the molecular pathogenesis of which remains incompletely elucidated. Lesion profiling with next-generation sequencing (NGS) can lead to the identification of previously unanticipated causative genes and the detection of therapeutically actionable genetic changes. Using an NGS panel that included 275 cancer susceptibility genes, this study examined the occurrence and frequency of somatic mutations in adenomyotic tissue specimens collected from 17 women. Extracted DNA was enriched using targeted formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue cores prior to the identification of lesion-specific variants. The results revealed that KRAS and AT-rich interactive domain 1A (ARID1A) were the two most frequently mutated genes (mutation frequencies: 24% and 12%, respectively). Notably, endometrial atypical hyperplasia did not involve adenomyotic areas. We also identified, for the first time, two potentially pathogenic mutations in the F-box/WD repeat-containing protein 7 (FBXW7) and cohesin subunit SA-2 (STAG2) genes. These findings indicate that mutations in the KRAS, ARID1A, FBXW7 and STAG2 genes may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of adenomyosis. Additional studies are needed to assess whether the utilisation of oncogenic driver mutations can inform the surveillance of patients with adenomyosis who had not undergone hysterectomy.Impact statementWhat is already known on this subject? Although somatic point mutations in the KRAS oncogene have been recently detected in adenomyosis, the molecular underpinnings of this condition remains incompletely elucidated. Lesion profiling with next-generation sequencing (NGS) can lead to the identification of previously unanticipated causative genes and the detection of therapeutically actionable genetic changes.What do the results of this study add? The results of NGS revealed that KRAS and AT-rich interactive domain 1A (ARID1A) were the two most frequently mutated genes (mutation frequencies: 24% and 12%, respectively).

Here, we confirmed that LL-37 expression enhanced endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration and invasion in HCC cells. And the HER2/EGFR-MAPK/ERK signal participated in the process above. More frequent lung metastases were observed in an LL-37-overexpressing hematogenous metastasis model. Interestingly, 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) together with si-LL-37 significantly enhanced 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-induced inhibition of migration and invasion in PLC/PRF-5 cells, and also enhanced reversion of the EMT process. Therefore, LL-37 is involved in HCC metastases, and may act as an important factor to attenuate the inhibitory activity of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) on HCC metastasis. Targeting hCAP18/LL-37 may offer a potential strategy to improve the anticancer activity of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) in HCC therapy.',\n","       'RNA-Binding Proteins as a Molecular Link between COPD and Lung Cancer.Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) represents an independent risk factor for lung cancer development. Accelerated cell senescence, induced by oxidative stress and inflammation, is a common pathogenic determinant of both COPD and lung cancer. The post transcriptional regulation of genes involved in these processes is finely regulated by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), which regulate mRNA turnover, subcellular localization, splicing and translation. Multiple pro-inflammatory mediators (including cytokines, chemokines, proteins, growth factors and others), responsible of lung microenvironment alteration, are regulated by RBPs. Several mouse models have shown the implication of RBPs in multiple mechanisms that sustain chronic inflammation and neoplastic transformation. However, further studies are required to clarify the role of RBPs in the pathogenic mechanisms shared by lung cancer and COPD, in order to identify novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. This review will therefore focus on the studies collectively indicating the role of RBPs in oxidative stress and chronic inflammation as common pathogenic mechanisms shared by lung cancer and COPD.',\n","       'Discovery of new pyridine-quinoline hybrids as competitive and non-competitive PIM-1 kinase inhibitors with apoptosis induction and caspase 3/7 activation capabilities.New quinoline-pyridine hybrids were designed and synthesised as PIM-1/2 kinase inhibitors. Compounds 5b, 5c, 6e, 13a, 13c, and 14a showed in-vitro low cytotoxicity against normal human lung fibroblast Wi-38 cell line and potent in-vitro anticancer activity against myeloid leukaemia (NFS-60), liver (HepG-2), prostate (PC-3), and colon (Caco-2) cancer cell lines. In addition, 6e, 13a, and 13c significantly induced apoptosis with percentage more than 66%. Moreover, 6e, 13a, and 13c significantly induced caspase 3/7 activation in HepG-2 cell line. Furthermore, 5c, 6e, and 14a showed potent in-vitro PIM-1 kinase inhibitory activity. While, 5b showed potent in-vitro PIM-2 kinase inhibitory activity. Kinetic studies using Lineweaver-Burk double-reciprocal plot indicated that 5b, 5c, 6e, and 14a behaved as competitive inhibitors while 13a behaved as both competitive and non-competitive inhibitor of PIM-1 kinase enzyme. Molecular docking studies indicated that, in-silico affinity came in coherence with the observed in-vitro inhibitory activities against PIM-1/2 kinases.',\n","       'Effect of epithelial-specific MyD88 signaling pathway on airway inflammatory response to organic dust exposure.The Toll-like receptor (TLR) adaptor protein MyD88 is integral to airway inflammatory response to microbial-enriched organic dust extract (ODE) exposures. ODE-induced airway neutrophil influx and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines was essentially abrogated in global MyD88-deficient mice, yet these mice demonstrate an increase in airway epithelial cell mucin expression. To further elucidate the role of MyD88-dependent responses specific to lung airway epithelial cells in response to ODE in\\xa0vivo, the surfactant protein C protein (SPC) Cre(+) embryologic expressing airway epithelial cells floxed for MyD88 to disrupt MyD88 signaling were utilized. The inducible club cell secretory protein (CCSP) Cre(+), MyD88 floxed, were also developed. Using an established protocol, mice were intranasally instilled with ODE or saline once or daily up to 3\\u2009weeks. Mice with MyD88-deficient SPC(+) lung epithelial cells exhibited decreased neutrophil influx following ODE exposure once and repetitively for 1\\u2009week without modulation of classic pro-inflammatory mediators including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and neutrophil chemoattractants. This protective response was lost after 3\\u2009weeks of repetitive exposure. ODE-induced Muc5ac mucin expression at 1\\u2009week was also reduced in MyD88-deficient SPC(+) cells. Acute ODE-induced IL-33 was reduced in MyD88-deficient SPC(+) cells whereas serum IgE levels were increased at one week. In contrast, mice with inducible MyD88-deficient CCSP(+) airway epithelial cells demonstrated no significant difference in experimental indices following ODE exposure. Collectively, these findings suggest that MyD88-dependent signaling targeted to all airway epithelial cells plays an important role in mediating neutrophil influx and mucin production in response to acute organic dust exposures.',\n","       'Malignant mesothelioma of the peritoneum mimicking primary peritonitis carcinomatosis..',\n","       'Structure-activity exploration of a small-molecule allosteric inhibitor of T790M/L858R double mutant EGFR.EGFR is a protein kinase whose aberrant activity is frequently involved in the development of non-small lung cancer (NSCLC) drug resistant forms. The allosteric inhibition of this enzyme is currently one among the most attractive approaches to design and develop anticancer drugs.

To the best of our knowledge, these compounds are the first dual inhibitors targeting these two enzymes. As both of them participate in the anticancer response, the effect of the compounds on a panel of cancer cell lines was examined.

However, the target AIMP2-DX2, AIMP2-lacking exon 2, is often detected in many cancer patients and cells. The predominant approach for targeting AIMP-DX2 has been attempted via small molecule mediated inhibition, but due to the lack of satisfactory activity against AIMP2-DX2, new therapeutic strategies are needed to develop a novel drug for AIMP2-DX2. Here, we report the use of the PROTAC strategy that combines small-molecule AIMP2-DX2 inhibitors with selective E3-ligase ligands with optimised linkers. Consequently, candidate compound 45 was found to be a degrader of AIMP2-DX2. Together, these findings demonstrate that our PROTAC technology targeting AIMP2-DX2 would be a potential new strategy for future lung cancer treatment.',\n","       'Development of 10-Hydroxycamptothecin-crizotinib conjugate based on the synergistic effect on lung cancer cells.The effect of the combination of 10-Hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) and crizotinib (CRI) on EGFR- and KRAS-mutant lung cancer cells was investigated and the conjugates of the two drugs were synthesised. HCPT combined with CRI synergistically inhibited the cell growth and proliferation of H1975, HCC827, and H460 without aggravating adverse effect on the normal cells. The combination synergistically enhanced the cell apoptosis rate through releasing Cyto-C by activation of Bcl-2 family-mediated mitochondrial signalling, which was associate with inactivating of EGFR related downstream signalling pathways including AKT, ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK. Based on this synergy, the conjugates of HCPT and CRI (compounds CH-1 and CH-2) with different chemical bonds were synthesised.

In lung cancer treatment, nebulized solid lipid nanoparticles may be a viable drug delivery method, helping the drug reach sites of action, and improving its inhalation efficiency and pulmonary deposition. This research focused on evaluating the effectiveness of solid lipid nanoparticles of favipiravir (Fav-SLNps) in facilitating drug delivery to sites of action in lung cancer treatment. METHODS: The hot-evaporation method was used to formulate Fav-SLNps. The in\\xa0vitro cell viability, anti-cancer effects, and cellular uptake activity were evaluated in A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells treated with the Fav-SLNp formulation. RESULTS: The Fav-SLNps were formulated successfully. Importantly, Fav-SLNps at a concentration of 322.6\\xa0μg/ml were found to be safe and non-toxic toward A549\\xa0cells in\\xa0vitro. The formulation had potential anti-proliferative properties via increasing the proportions of cells in G2/M and G0/G1 phases to 1.20 and 1.13 times those in untreated cells. Additionally, Fav-SLNp treatment significantly induced necrosis in A549\\xa0cells. Furthermore, the use of SLNps in the Fav formulation resulted in a macrophage drug uptake 1.23 times that of the free drug.

Therefore, a technology for controlling CSCs is needed to overcome such resistance to cancer therapy. Various evidences about the association between epithelial-mesenchymal transition related transcriptomic alteration and acquisition of CSC phenotype have been proposed recently. Down-regulated miR-26a-5p is closely related to mesenchymal-like lung cancer cell lines. These findings suggest that miR-26a-5p might be involved in lung cancer stemness. RNA polymerase III subunit G (POLR3G) was selected as a candidate target of miR-26a-5p related to cancer stemness. It was found that miR-26a-5p directly regulates the expression of POLR3G.Overexpression of miR-26a-5p induced a marked reduction of colony formation and sphere formation. Co-treatment of miR-26a-5p and paclitaxel decreased cell growth, suggesting that miR-26a-5p might play a role as a chemotherapy sensitizer. In the cancer genome atlas data, high miR-26a-5p and low POLR3G expression were also related to higher survival rate of patients with lung adenocarcinoma.

Chen & C. Ling, also known as Wen-E-Zhu, has been used for cancer treatment since ancient times, with roots dating back to the Song Dynasty. Elemene (EE), a sesquiterpene extract with potent anticancer properties, is extracted from Wen-E-Zhu, with β-elemene (BE) being its main active compound, along with trace amounts of β-caryophyllene (BC), γ-elemene and δ-elemene isomers. EE has demonstrated broad-spectrum anti-cancer effects and is commonly used in clinical treatments for various types of malignant cancers, including lung cancer. Studies have shown that EE can arrest the cell cycle, inhibit cancer cell proliferation, and induce apoptosis and autophagy. However, the exact mechanism of its anti-lung cancer activity remains unclear and requires further research and investigation. AIM OF THE STUDY: In this study, the possible mechanism of EE and its main active components, BE and BC, against lung adenocarcinoma was investigated by using A549 and PC9 cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The subcutaneous tumor model of nude mice was constructed to evaluate the efficacy of EE in vivo, then the in vitro half-inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of EE and its main active components, BE and BC, on A549 and PC9 cells at different concentrations were determined by CCK-8. Flow cytometry was used to detect the apoptosis and cycle of A549 and PC9 cells treated with different concentrations of BE and BC for 24\\xa0h. Non-targeted metabolomics analysis was performed on A549\\xa0cells to explore potential target pathways, which were subsequently verified through kit detection and western blot analysis. RESULTS: Injection of EE in A549 tumor-bearing mice effectively suppressed cancer growth in vivo. The IC(50) of EE and its main active components, BE and BC, was around 60\\xa0μg/mL. Flow cytometry analysis showed that BE and BC blocked the G(2)/M and S phases of lung adenocarcinoma cells and induced apoptosis, leading to a significant reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Results from non-targeted metabolomics analysis indicated that the glutathione metabolism pathway in A549\\xa0cells was altered after treatment with the active components. Kit detection revealed a decrease in glutathione (GSH) levels and an increase in the levels of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and reactive oxygen (ROS). Supplementation of GSH reduced the inhibitory activity of the active components on lung cancer and also decreased the ROS content of cells. Analysis of glutathione synthesis-related proteins showed a decrease in the expression of glutaminase, cystine/glutamate reverse transporter (SLC7A11), and glutathione synthase (GS), while the expression of glutamate cysteine ligase modified subunit (GCLM) was increased. In the apoptosis-related pathway, Bax protein and cleaved caspase-9/caspase-9 ratio were up-regulated and Bcl-2 protein was down-regulated. CONCLUSIONS: EE, BE, and BC showed significant inhibitory effects on the growth of lung adenocarcinoma cells, and the mechanism of action was linked to the glutathione system. By down-regulating the expression of proteins related to GSH synthesis, EE and its main active components BE and BC disrupted the cellular redox system and thereby promoted cell apoptosis.',\n","       'Corrigendum to \"Disclosing targets and pharmacological mechanisms of total bioflavonoids extracted from Selaginella doederleinii against non-small cell lung cancer by combination of network pharmacology and proteomics\" [J.

Developing effective treatment for SCI in the clinic is extremely challenging because of the restrictive axonal regenerative ability and disconnection of neural elements after injury, as well as the limited systemic drug delivery efficiency caused by blood spinal cord barrier. To develop an effective non-invasive treatment strategy for SCI in clinic, we generated an autologous plasma exosome (AP-EXO) based biological scaffold where AP-EXO was loaded with neuron targeting peptide (RVG) and growth-facilitating peptides (ILP and ISP). This scaffold can be targeted delivered to neurons in the injured area and elicit robust axon regrowth across the lesion core to the levels over 30-fold greater than naïve treatment, thus reestablish the intraspinal circuits and promote motor functional recovery after spinal cord injury in mice. More importantly, in ex vivo, human plasma exosomes (HP-EXO) loaded with combinatory peptides of RVG, ILP and ISP showed safety and no liver and kidney toxicity in the application to nude SCI mice. Combining the efficacy and safety, the AP-EXO-based personalized treatment confers functional recovery after SCI and showed immense promising in biomedical applications in treating SCI.

Here, the uptake of lamellar (liposomes) versus non-lamellar (cubosomes) lipid nanoparticles in macrophages and lung epithelial cells was quantified and the influence of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), containing native pulmonary protein and surfactant molecules is determined. Cubosome uptake in both macrophages and epithelial cells was strongly mediated by a high percentage of molecular function regulatory and binding proteins present within the protein corona. In contrast, the protein corona did not influence the uptake of liposomes in epithelial cells. In macrophages, the proteins mediated a rapid internalisation, followed by exocytosis of liposomes after 6\\xa0h incubation. These findings on the influence of biological fluid in regulating lipid nanoparticle uptake mechanisms may guide future development of optimal intracellular delivery systems for therapeutics via the pulmonary route.',\n","       'Breathing-Adapted Imaging Techniques for Rapid 4-Dimensional Lung Tomosynthesis.PURPOSE: This article presents enhancements to a 4-dimensional (4D) lung digital tomosynthesis (DTS) model introduced in a 2018 paper. That model was proposed as an adjunct to 4D computed tomography (4DCT) to improve tumor localization through artifact reduction achieved by imaging the entire lung in all projections, reducing the projection collection time duration for each phase compared with 4DCT, and requiring only a single-breath cycle to capture all phases. This is applicable to SABR treatment planning. Enhancements comprise customized patient 4D-DTS x-ray scanning parameters. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Imaging parameters derived with the 4D-DTS model were arc duration, frames per second, pulse duration, and tube current normalized to single-chest radiographic milliampere-seconds (mA/mAs(AEC)). Optimized phase-specific DTS projections imaging parameters were derived for volunteer respiration-tracking surrogate waveforms and for sinusoidal waveforms. These parameters are temporally matched to the respiratory surrogate waveform and presented as continuous data plots during a period of 20 seconds. Comparison is made between surrogate excursions during a single-phase CT and 4D-DTS reconstructions. RESULTS: 4D-DTS imaging techniques were customized to volunteer respiratory waveforms and sinusoidal waveforms. Technique settings at the highest velocity portions of the volunteer waveforms were arc duration 0.066 seconds, frame rate 921 Hz, pulse duration 1.076 ms, and normalized tube current 76.2 s(-1). Technique settings at the highest velocity portions of the sinusoidal waveforms were arc duration 0.029 seconds, frame rate 2074 Hz, pulse duration 0.472 ms, and normalized tube current 173.6 s(-1). Sinusoidal surrogate excursion distance at the highest velocity portion of the waveform during a CT rotation of 0.5 seconds ranged from 2.68 to 21.09 mm, all greater than the limiting excursion distance chosen in the 4D-DTS model. CONCLUSIONS: 4D-DTS image technique settings can be customized to individual patient breathing patterns so that captured range of motion satisfies an operator-selected value.',\n","       'Co-delivery of gemcitabine and paclitaxel plus NanoCpG empowers chemoimmunotherapy of postoperative \"cold\" triple-negative breast cancer.Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) due to lack of clear target and notorious \"cold\" tumor microenvironment (TME) is one of the most intractable and lethal malignancies. Tuning \"cold\" TME into \"hot\" becomes an emerging therapeutic strategy to TNBC. Herewith, we report that integrin-targeting micellar gemcitabine and paclitaxel (ATN-mG/P, ATN sequence: Ac-PhScNK-NH(2)) cooperating with polymersomal CpG (NanoCpG) effectively \"heated up\" and treated TNBC. ATN-mG/P exhibited greatly boosted apoptotic activity in 4T1 cells, induced potent immunogenic cell death (ICD), and efficiently stimulated maturation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs). Remarkably, in a postoperative TNBC model, ATN-mG/P combining with NanoCpG promoted strong anti-cancer immune responses, showing a greatly augmented proportion of mature DCs and CD8(+) T cells while reduced immune-suppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T cells (T(reg)), which led to complete inhibition of lung metastasis and 60% mice tumor-free. The co-delivery of gemcitabine and paclitaxel at desired ratio in combination with NanoCpG provides a unique platform for potent chemoimmunotherapy of \"cold\" tumors like TNBC.',\n","       'Molecular signaling network and therapeutic developments in breast cancer brain metastasis.Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers in women worldwide. It has surpassed lung cancer as the leading cause of cancer-related death. Breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) is becoming a major clinical concern that is commonly associated with ER-ve and HER2+ve subtypes of BC patients. Metastatic lesions in the brain originate when the cancer cells detach from a primary breast tumor and establish metastatic lesions and infiltrate near and distant organs via systemic blood circulation by traversing the BBB. The colonization of BC cells in the brain involves a complex interplay in the tumor microenvironment (TME), metastatic cells, and brain cells like endothelial cells, microglia, and astrocytes. BCBM is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality and presents a challenge to developing successful cancer therapy. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanism of BCBM and novel therapeutic strategies for patients with brain metastatic BC.',\n","       'Genotoxicity and maternal-fetal safety of the dried extract of leaves of Azadirachta indica A. Juss (Meliaceae) in Wistar rats.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Azadirachta indica A. Juss (Meliaceae), popularly known as \"neem\", is used for the treatment of rheumatism, cancer, ulcers, diabetes, respiratory problems, among others. This species is present on six continents and contains more than 400 bioactive compounds. Practically all parts of the plant are used in the treatment of diseases. Although it is widely used, no study has evaluated the safety of this species throughout the gestational period in Wistar rats. AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the genotoxicity and the effect of treatment with dried extract of leaves of Azadirachta indica on maternal toxicity and fetal development. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The dried extract of leaves of A. indica was obtained by spray drying after percolation of the plant material in 30% ethanol (w/w). The total flavonoids and rutin contents of the extract were determined by spectrophotometric method and HPLC-DAD, respectively. Pregnant Wistar rats (n\\xa0=\\xa040) were divided into four groups (n\\xa0=\\xa010/group): one control and three groups treated with dried extract of leaves of A. indica at doses of 300, 600 or 1200\\xa0mg/kg. Treatments were carried out from gestational day (GD) 0-20. During gestation, clinical signs of toxicity, weight gain, feed and water consumption of the dams were evaluated. On GD 21, rats were euthanized and cardiac blood was collected. Liver, kidneys, lung, heart, uterus, ovaries and bone marrow were collected. Reproductive performance parameters, histopathological analysis, biochemistry and genotoxicity were evaluated. Fetuses were evaluated for external morphology, skeletal and visceral changes. RESULTS: The total flavonoid content of the extract ranged from 2.64 to 3.01%, and the rutin content was 1.07%. There was no change in body mass gain, food and water consumption between the evaluated groups. There was also no difference between the groups in terms of biochemical parameters, reproductive performance, histopathological analysis of the mother\\'s organs and genotoxicity. Supernumerary ossification sites of the sternum were observed, and other skeletal and visceral alterations were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment did not induce maternal toxicity, it was neither embryotoxic nor fetotoxic. The extract was not potentially genotoxic, and at a dose of 1200\\xa0mg/kg, it caused changes in the ossification of the sternum.',\n","       'The anti-tumor effects of Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb. and its monomer composition: A review.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb. has been included in \"The Plant List\" (http://www. theplantlist.org) and is the most widely researched species in its genus. It is called Nanshe Teng in China. Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb. is a plant of Euonymus and it\\'s medicinal part is the vine and stem. It is also called Alias Dragon grass, Yellow Yine, etc. It has good anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory and other effects. More and more studies have shown that Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb. has a significant therapeutic effect on a variety of malignant tumors. The research on Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb. has a good application prospect for the development of anti-tumor drugs. However, no systematic reports on Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb. have been published before. AIM OF THE REVIEW: This paper summarizes the metabolic products for anti-tumor and the mechanism for anti-tumor of Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb. to provide reference for further development and research. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The relevant information on Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb. was collected from the scientific databases including PubMed, CNKI, ScienceDirect, Wiley, Springer, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Baidu Scholar, Pharmacopoeia of the People\\'s Republic of China and Flora Republicae Popularis Sinicae, etc. RESULTS: At present, more than 200 compounds have been identified from Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb., including terpenoids, flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, polyketides and benzene derivatives, etc. Pharmacological studies have shown that Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb. has a variety effects of inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, inducing tumor cell apoptosis, inhibiting tumor cells invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis, reversing multi-drug resistance, and also collaborativing Micro RNA to inhibit tumor growth, etc. It has a significant effect on gastric cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer, etc. The extracts of Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb. have been widely used in experiments, and the toxic and side effects are small. CONCLUSIONS: Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb. is rich in chemical constituents, diverse in pharmacological activities and abundant in resources, which is widely used in clinics from traditional to modern. However, there is no systematic report on the chemical compounds and anti-tumor effects of Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb.

Curcumae Rhizoma, the main essential oil component of which is curcumol, is widely used for the treatment of phymatosis in China due to its antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antithrombin, anti-tissue fibrosis and anti-oxygen pharmacological activities, but its potential for the treatment of UFs has not been evaluated. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of curcumol intervention in human uterine leiomyoma cells (UMCs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Putative targets of curcumol intervention in UFs were identified using network pharmacology strategies. Molecular docking was performed to assess the binding affinity of curcumol to core targets. A concentration gradient of curcumol (0, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500\\xa0μM) or RU-486 (mifepristone, 0, 10, 20, 40, 50, and 100\\xa0μM) was applied to UMCs, and cell viability was detected by the CCK-8 assay. Cell apoptosis and cell cycle were examined by flow cytometry, and cell migration was assessed by a wound-healing assay. Additionally, the mRNA and protein expression levels of critical pathway components were evaluated by RT‒PCR and western blotting. Finally, the actions of curcumol on different tumor cell lines were summarized. RESULTS: Network pharmacology predicted 62 genes with roles in the treatment of UFs with curcumol, and MAPK14 (p38MAPK) displayed a higher interaction degree. GO enrichment and KEGG analyses revealed that the core genes were abundantly enriched in the MAPK signaling pathway. The molecular binding of curcumol to core targets was relatively stable. In UMCs, 200, 300 and 400\\xa0μM curcumol treatment for 24\\xa0h decreased cell viability compared with that in the control group, and the greatest effect was detected at 48\\xa0h and maintained until 72\\xa0h. Curcumol arrested cells in the G0/G1 phase and subsequently suppressed mitosis, promoted early apoptosis and reduced the degree of wound healing in a concentration-dependent manner in UMCs. Furthermore, 200\\xa0μM curcumol decreased the mRNA and protein expression of p38MAPK, the mRNA expression of NF-κB, and the protein expression of Ki-67 and increased the mRNA and protein expression of Caspase 9. Curcumol (300 and 400\\xa0μM) decreased the mRNA and protein expression of p38MAPK, NF-κB, and Ki-67 and increased the protein expression of Caspase 9 in UMCs. Curcumol was demonstrated to treat tumor cell lines, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer, liver cancer and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, but its effects on benign tumors have not yet been reported. CONCLUSION: Curcumol suppresses cell proliferation and cell migration while arresting the cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase and inducing cell apoptosis in UMCs via a mechanism related to p38MAPK/NF-κB pathway regulation. Curcumol may be a potential therapeutic and preventive agent in the treatment of benign tumors such as UFs.',\n","       'Female reproductive and hormonal factors and lung cancer mortality among never-smokers: A prospective cohort study of 287\\u2009408 Chinese women.There is growing, but inconsistent evidence suggesting oestrogen may play a key role in lung cancer development, especially among never-smoking women for whom lung cancer risk factors remain largely elusive. Using the China Kadoorie Biobank, a large-scale prospective cohort with 302\\u2009510 women aged 30 to 79\\u2009years recruited from 10 regions in China during 2004 to 2008, we assessed the risk of lung cancer death among self-reported never-smoking women who were cancer-free at baseline, in relation to age at menarche, age at menopause, time since menopause, prior use of oral contraceptives (OCP), number of livebirths, breastfeeding and age at first livebirth. Women were followed up to December 31, 2016 with linkage to mortality data. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using Cox regression, adjusting for key confounders including several socio-demographic, environmental and lifestyle factors. Among 287\\u2009408 never-smoking women, 814 died from lung cancer with a median follow-up of 10.3\\u2009years. Women who had used OCP within 15\\u2009years prior to baseline had a significantly higher hazard of lung cancer death compared with never-users: HR\\xa0=\\xa01.85 (95% CI: 1.14-3.00) and risk increased by 6% with each additional year of use: HR\\xa0=\\xa01.06 (1.01-1.10). Among parous women, the hazard of lung cancer death increased by 13% with each single livebirth: HR\\xa0=\\xa01.13 (1.05-1.23); and among post-menopausal women, the risk increased by 2% with each year since menopause: HR\\xa0=\\xa01.02 (1.01-1.04). These results suggest that reproductive factors which were proxies for lower endogenous oestrogen level, for example, longer duration of OCP use, could play a role in lung cancer development.',\n","       'STAT3 silencing by an aptamer-based strategy hampers the crosstalk between NSCLC cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts.The identification of new effective therapeutic options for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents a crucial challenge in oncology. Recent studies indicate that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) participate in tumor progression by establishing a favorable microenvironment that promotes cancer progression. Therefore, the development of strategies inhibiting the interplay between CAFs and cancer cells is considered a winning approach for the development of effective anti-cancer drugs. Among other factors, the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) has been reported as a key mediator of CAF oncogenic actions, representing a promising therapeutic target. Here, we applied an aptamer-based conjugate (named Gint4.T-STAT3), containing a STAT3 siRNA linked to an aptamer binding and inhibiting the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)β, to obtain STAT3-specific silencing and interfere with CAF pro-tumorigenic functions. We demonstrated that this molecule effectively delivers the STAT3 siRNA in NSCLC cells, and blocks CAF-induced cancer cell growth and migration and reduced spheroid dimension. In addition, we found that Gint4.T-STAT3 alters CAF phenotype, thus functioning as a double-acting molecule able to inhibit the entire tumor bulk. Our data provide a proof of principle for the targeting of CAF pro-tumor functions through an aptamer-based drug, and can open innovative horizons in NSCLC therapy.',\n","       'Delivery of anti-microRNA-21 by lung-targeted liposomes for pulmonary fibrosis treatment.Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disorder with a low survival rate. Pulmonary fibrosis is one of the complications of COVID-19 and has a high prevalence in COVID-19 patients. Currently, no effective therapies other than lung transplantation are available to cure IPF and post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that mediate the development and progression of pulmonary fibrosis, thus making them potent drug candidates for this serious disease. MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) promotes not only the differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts but also epithelial-mesenchymal transition, both of which have been proposed as fundamental processes in pulmonary fibrosis development. Delivery of anti-miR-21 to block the miR-21-associated fibrogenic pathways represents a promising therapy for pulmonary fibrosis. However, microRNA treatment is challenged by quick degradation of RNA in blood, poor cellular uptake, and off-target effects. To overcome these challenges, we developed a lung-targeted, cationic liposome formulation to encapsulate anti-miR-21, enhance its delivery efficiency, and improve the therapeutic efficacy. We optimized the liposome formulation and demonstrated the anti-fibrotic effects using both in\\xa0vitro and in\\xa0vivo lung fibrosis models. Our results showed that anti-miR-21 delivered by cationic liposomes suppressed myofibroblast differentiation, reduced the synthesis of extracellular matrix, and inhibited fibrosis progression.',\n","       'Betulinic acid, a major therapeutic triterpene of Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb., acts as a chemosensitizer of gemcitabine by promoting Chk1 degradation.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb., also called as oriental bittersweet vine or climbing spindle berry, a traditional Chinese herbal medicine has been used to treat a spectrum of painful and inflammatory diseases for centuries. Explored for their unique medicinal properties, C.orbiculatus offers additional therapeutic effects on cancerous diseases. The effect of single-agent gemcitabine on survival has not long been encouraging, combination therapies provide patients multiple chances of benefit for improved clinical response. AIMS OF THIS STUDY: This study aims at expounding the chemopotentiating effects and underlying mechanisms of betulinic acid, a primary therapeutic triterpene of C. orbiculatus in combination with gemcitabine chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The preparation of betulinic acid was optimized using ultrasonic-assisted extraction method. Gemcitabine-resistant cell model was established by induction of the cytidine deaminase. MTT, colony formation, EdU incorporation and Annexin V/PI staining assays were used to evaluate cytotoxicity, cell proliferation and apoptosis in BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cell line and H1299 non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line. Comet assay, metaphase chromosome spread and γH2AX immunostaining were applied for DNA damage assessment. Western blot and co-immunoprecipitation was used to detect the phosphorylation and ubiquitination of Chk1. Mode of action of gemcitabine in combination with betulinic acid was further captured in BxPC-3-derived mouse xenograft model. RESULTS: We noticed that the extraction method had an impact on the thermal stability of C. orbiculatus. Ultrasound-assisted extraction at room temperature in shorter processing time could maximize the overall yields and biological activities of C. orbiculatus. The major constituent was identified as betulinic acid, and the pentacyclic triterpene represented the prominent anticancer activity of C. orbiculatus. Forced expression of cytidine deaminase conferred acquired resistance to gemcitabine, while betulinic acid displayed equivalent cytotoxicity toward gemcitabine-resistant and sensitive cells. A combination therapy of gemcitabine with betulinic acid produced synergistic pharmacologic interaction on cell viability, apoptosis and DNA double-strand breaks. Moreover, betulinic acid abrogated gemcitabine-triggered Chk1 activation by destabilizing Chk1 loading via proteasomal degradation. The combination of gemcitabine and betulinic acid significantly retarded BxPC-3 tumor growth in vivo compared to single-agent gemcitabine treatment alone, accompanied with reduced Chk1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence that betulinic acid is a potential candidate for chemosensitization as a naturally occurring Chk1 inhibitor and warrants further preclinical evaluation.',\n","       'Phagocytosis increases an oxidative metabolic and immune suppressive signature in tumor macrophages.Phagocytosis is a key macrophage function, but how phagocytosis shapes tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) phenotypes and heterogeneity in solid tumors remains unclear. Here, we utilized both syngeneic and novel autochthonous lung tumor models in which neoplastic cells express the fluorophore tdTomato (tdTom) to identify TAMs that have phagocytosed neoplastic cells in vivo. Phagocytic tdTompos TAMs upregulated antigen presentation and anti-inflammatory proteins, but downregulated classic proinflammatory effectors compared to tdTomneg TAMs. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling identified TAM subset-specific and common gene expression changes associated with phagocytosis. We uncover a phagocytic signature that is predominated by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), ribosomal, and metabolic genes, and this signature correlates with worse clinical outcome in human lung cancer. Expression of OXPHOS proteins, mitochondrial content, and functional utilization of OXPHOS were increased in tdTompos TAMs. tdTompos tumor dendritic cells also display similar metabolic changes. Our identification of phagocytic TAMs as a distinct myeloid cell state links phagocytosis of neoplastic cells in vivo with OXPHOS and tumor-promoting phenotypes.',\n","       'CCL5-producing migratory dendritic cells guide CCR5+ monocytes into the draining lymph nodes.Dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes capture, transport, and present antigen to cognate T cells in the draining lymph nodes (LNs) in a CCR7-dependent manner. Since only migratory DCs express this chemokine receptor, it is unclear how monocytes reach the LN. In steady-state and following inhalation of several PAMPs, scRNA-seq identified LN mononuclear phagocytes as monocytes, resident, or migratory type 1 and type 2 conventional (c)DCs, despite the downregulation of Xcr1, Clec9a, H2-Ab1, Sirpa, and Clec10a transcripts on migratory cDCs. Migratory cDCs, however, upregulated Ccr7, Ccl17, Ccl22, and Ccl5. Migratory monocytes expressed Ccr5, a high-affinity receptor for Ccl5. Using two tracking methods, we observed that both CD88hiCD26lomonocytes and CD88-CD26hi cDCs captured inhaled antigens in the lung and migrated to LNs. Antigen exposure in mixed-chimeric Ccl5-, Ccr2-, Ccr5-, Ccr7-, and Batf3-deficient mice demonstrated that while antigen-bearing DCs use CCR7 to reach the LN, monocytes use CCR5 to follow CCL5-secreting migratory cDCs into the LN, where they regulate DC-mediated immunity.',\n","       'Spatial mapping reveals granuloma diversity and histopathological superstructure in human tuberculosis.The hallmark of tuberculosis (TB) is the formation of immune cell-enriched aggregates called granulomas. While granulomas are pathologically diverse, their tissue-wide heterogeneity has not been spatially resolved at the single-cell level in human tissues. By spatially mapping individual immune cells in every lesion across entire tissue sections, we report that in addition to necrotizing granulomas, the human TB lung contains abundant non-necrotizing leukocyte aggregates surrounding areas of necrotizing tissue. These cellular lesions were more diverse in composition than necrotizing lesions and could be stratified into four general classes based on cellular composition and spatial distribution of B cells and macrophages. The cellular composition of non-necrotizing structures also correlates with their proximity to necrotizing lesions, indicating these are foci of distinct immune reactions adjacent to necrotizing granulomas. Together, we show that during TB, diseased lung tissue develops a histopathological superstructure comprising at least four different types of non-necrotizing cellular aggregates organized as satellites of necrotizing granulomas.',\n","       'Acetylation regulates the nucleocytoplasmic distribution and oncogenic function of karyopherin alpha 2 in lung adenocarcinoma.Karyopherin subunit alpha 2 (KPNA2, importin α1) is a nucleoplasmic protein responsible for the nuclear import of proteins with classical nuclear localization signals. Aberrant nuclear accumulation of KPNA2 has been observed in numerous cancer tissues. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is involved in the phosphorylation and acetylation of KPNA2 in enterocytes. However, the impact of these post-translational modifications on modulating the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of KPNA2 and its oncogenic role remain unclear. Unlike nuclear accumulation of wild-type KPNA2, which promoted lung cancer cell migration, KPNA2 Lys22 acetylation-mimicking mutations (K22Q and K22Q/S105A) prevented nuclear localization of KPNA2 and reduced the cell migration ability. Cytosolic KPNA2 K22Q interacted with and restricted the nuclear entry of E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1), an oncogenic cargo protein of KPNA2, in lung cancer cells. Intriguingly, the AMPK activator EX229 promoted the nuclear export of KPNA2 S105A. However, the CBP/p300 inhibitor CCS-1477 abolished this phenomenon, suggesting that CBP/p300-mediated acetylation of KPNA2 promoted KPNA2 nuclear export in lung cancer cells. Collectively, our findings suggest that the CBP/p300 positively regulates KPNA2 acetylation, which enhances its cytosolic localization and suppresses its oncogenic activity in lung cancer.',\n","       'Thioredoxin facilitates hepatocellular carcinoma stemness and metastasis by increasing BACH1 stability to activate the AKT/mTOR pathway.Thioredoxin (TXN) is essential for preserving balance and controlling the intracellular redox state. Most studies have focused on the function of TXN in redox reactions, which is critical for tumor progression. Here, we showed that TXN promotes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) stemness properties in a non-redox-dependent manner, which has rarely been reported in previous studies. TXN exhibited upregulated expression in human HCC specimens, which was associated with a poor prognosis. Functional studies showed that TXN promoted HCC stemness properties and facilitated HCC metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, TXN promoted the stemness of HCC cells by interacting with BTB and CNC homology 1 (BACH1) and stabilized BACH1 expression by inhibiting its ubiquitination. BACH1 was positively correlated with TXN expression and was significantly upregulated in HCC. In addition, BACH1 promotes HCC stemness by activating the AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Furthermore, we found that the specific inhibition of TXN in combination with lenvatinib in mice significantly improved the treatment of metastatic HCC. In summary, our data demonstrate that TXN plays a crucial role in HCC stemness and BACH1 plays an integral part in regulating this process by activating the AKT/mTOR pathway. Thus, TXN is a promising target for metastatic HCC therapy.',\n","       'COVID-19 Lung Disease: Lessons Learned.nan',\n","       'Concurrent induction of apoptosis and necroptosis in\\xa0apigenin‑treated malignant mesothelioma cells: Reversal of\\xa0Warburg effect through Akt inhibition and p53 upregulation.A high dependence on aerobic glycolysis, known as the Warburg effect, is one of the metabolic features exhibited by tumor cells. Therefore, targeting glycolysis is becoming a very promising strategy for the development of anticancer drugs. In the present study, it was investigated whether pre‑adaptation of malignant mesothelioma (MM) cells to an acidic environment was associated with a metabolic shift to the Warburg phenotype in energy production, and whether apigenin targets acidosis‑driven metabolic reprogramming. Cell viability, glycolytic activity, Annexin V‑PE binding activity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP content, western blot analysis and spheroid viability were assessed in the present study. MM cells pre‑adapted to lactic acid were resistant to the anticancer drug gemcitabine, increased Akt activation, downregulated p53 expression, and upregulated rate‑limiting enzymes in glucose metabolism compared with their parental cells. Apigenin treatment increased cytotoxicity, Akt inactivation and p53 upregulation. Apigenin also reduced glucose uptake along with downregulation of key regulatory enzymes in glycolysis, increased ROS levels with loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and downregulated the levels of complexes I, III and IV in the mitochondrial electron transport chain with intracellular ATP depletion, resulting in upregulation of molecules mediating apoptosis and necroptosis. Apigenin‑induced alterations of cellular responses were similar to those of Akt inactivation by Ly294002. Overall, the present results provide mechanistic evidence supporting the anti‑glycolytic and cytotoxic role of apigenin via inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and p53 upregulation.',\n","       'Fuzheng Kang-Ai inhibits NSCLC cell proliferation via regulating hsa_circ_0048091/hsa-miR-378g/ARRDC3 pathway.BACKGROUND: Current treatments for lung cancer have their own deficiencies, such as severe adverse effect. Therefore, more safe and effective drugs are needed. PURPOSE: Fuzheng Kang-Ai (FZKA for short) has been applied as an adjuvant\\xa0treatment in advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients for decades in China, showing a definitive effect with minimal toxicities. However, the underlying mechanism is yet to be identified. STUDY DESIGN: Both in vitro and in vivo experiments were performed in this study to identify the exact mechanism by which FZKA inhibits NSCLC cell proliferation. METHODS: MTT and CCK-8 assays were used to detect cell viability. Xenograft model was performed for in vivo experiments. CircRNA and miRNA sequencing were used to find the differentially expressed circRNAs and miRNAs, respectively. qRT-PCR was performed to check the expression levels of circRNA, miRNA and mRNA. BaseScope was carried out to observe the expression of circRNA in situ. Actinomycin D and RNase R experiments were done to show the stability of circRNA. Nuclear-cytoplasmic fractionation and FISH were used to identify the localization of circRNA and miRNA. Pull-down, RIP, and luciferase activity assays were performed to show the biding ability of circRNA, miRNA and target proteins. Flow cytometry was done to observe cell apoptosis. Western blot and IHC were done to detect the protein expression. TCGA database was used to analyze the survival rate. RESULTS: FZKA inhibits NSCLC cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Hsa_circ_0048091 and hsa-miR-378g were the most differentially expressed circRNA and miRNA, respectively, after FZKA treatment. Silencing hsa_circ_0048091 and overexpressing hsa-miR-378g promoted cell proliferation and reversed the inhibition effect of FZKA on NSCLC, respectively. Hsa-miR-378g was sponged by hsa_circ_0048091, and the overexpression of miR-378g reversed the inhibition effect of hsa_ circ_0048091 on NSCLC. ARRDC3, as a target of hsa-miR-378g, was increased by FZKA treatment. Silencing ARRDC3 reversed both the inhibition effect of FZKA and miR-378g inhibitor on NSCLC. CONCLUSION: This study, for the first time, has established the function of hsa_circ_0048091, hsa- miR-378g, and ARRDC3 in lung cancer. It also shows that FZKA inhibits NSCLC cell proliferation through hsa_circ_0048091/hsa-miR-378g/ARRDC3 pathway, uncovering a novel mechanism by which FZKA controls human NSCLC cell growth.',\n","       'Panax notoginseng saponins normalises tumour blood vessels by inhibiting EphA2 gene expression to modulate the tumour microenvironment of breast cancer.BACKGROUND: Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS), the main active component of Panax notoginseng, can promote vascular microcirculation. PNS exhibits antitumor effects in various cancers. However, the molecular basis of the relationship between PNS and tumor blood vessels remains unclear. PURPOSE: To study the relationship between PNS inhibiting the growth and metastasis of breast cancer and promoting the normalization of blood vessels. METHODS: We performed laser speckle imaging of tumor microvessels and observed the effects of PNS on tumor growth and metastasis of MMTV-PyMT (FVB) spontaneous breast cancer in a transgenic mouse model. Immunohistochemical staining of Ki67 and CD31 was performed for tumors, scanning electron microscopy was used to observe tumor vascular morphology, and flow cytometry was used to detect tumor tissue immune microenvironment (TME). RNA-seq analysis was performed using the main vessels of the tumor tissues of the mice. HUVECs were cultured in tumor supernatant in vitro to simulate tumor microenvironment and verify the sequencing differential key genes. RESULTS: After treatment with PNS, we observed that tumor growth was suppressed, the blood perfusion of the systemic tumor microvessels in the mice increased, and the number of lung metastases decreased. Moreover, the vascular density of the primary tumor increased, and the vascular epidermis was smoother and flatter. Moreover, the number of tumor-associated macrophages in the tumor microenvironment was reduced, and the expression levels of IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α were reduced in the tumor tissues. PNS downregulated the expression of multiple genes associated with tumor angiogenesis, migration, and adhesion. In vitro tubule formation experiments revealed that PNS promoted the formation and connection of tumor blood vessels and normalized the vessel morphology primarily by inhibiting EphA2 expression. In addition, PNS inhibited the expression of tumor vascular marker proteins and vascular migration adhesion-related proteins in vivo. CONCLUSION: In this study, we found that PNS promoted the generation and connection of tumor vascular endothelial cells, revealing the key role of EphA2 in endothelial cell adhesion and tumor blood vessel morphology. PNS can inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of breast cancer by inhibiting EphA2, improving the immune microenvironment of breast cancer and promoting the normalization of tumor blood vessels.',\n","       'Novel 4-Amino-Quinazoline moieties ligated Platinum(IV) prodrugs overcome cisplatin resistance in EGFR(WT) human lung cancer.Developing bioactive axial ligands ligated platinum(IV) complexes with advantages over monotherapy and drug combinations is an efficient strategy to ameliorate the clinical defects of platinum(II) drugs. In this article, a series of 4-amino-quinazoline moieties (privileged pharmacophores of well-studied EGFR inhhibitors) ligated platinum(IV) were synthesized and evaluated for their anticancer activities. Among the complex, 17b demonstrated higher cytotoxicity against the tested lung cancer cells (including CDDP-resistant A549/CDDP cells) while lower cytotoxicity toward human normal cells than Oxaliplatin (Oxa) or cisplatin (CDDP). Mechanistic investigation demonstrated that the enhanced intracellular uptake of 17b efficiently elevated the of reactive oxygen species levels by 6.1 times more than Oxa. Detailed mechanisms of overcoming CDDP resistance revealed that 17b significantly induced apoptosis via inducing severe DNA damage, disturbing mitochondrial transmembrane potentials, efficiently disturbing EGFR-PI3K-Akt signaling transduction and activating a mitochondria-dependent apoptosis pathway. Besides, 17b significantly inhibited migration and invasion in A549/CDDP cells. In vivo tests exhibited that 17b obtained superior antitumor effect and attenuated systemic toxicity in A549/CDDP xenografts. All these results emphasized that the antitumor action of 17b differed from that of. classical platinum(II) drugs and provided a novel practical method to overcome CDDP resistance in lung cancer.',\n","       'LncRNA DGUOK-AS1 facilitates non-small cell lung cancer growth and metastasis through increasing TRPM7 stability via m6A modification.BACKGROUND: N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification plays key roles in tumor progression. LncRNA deoxyguanosine kinase antisense RNA 1 (DGUOK-AS1) has been reported as a promoter in tumors, but its role and mechanism in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) development remain uncertain. METHODS: Cell proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis were investigated via CCK-8, colony formation, transwell, and tube formation assays, respectively. The location of DGUOK-AS1 was detected via FISH assay. The interaction relationship among DGUOK-AS1, IGF2BP2 and TRPM7 was confirmed by RIP and MeRIP assays. The effects of DGUOK-AS1 on NSCLC growth and metastasis in vivo were investigated using xenograft and pulmonary metastatic models. RESULTS: DGUOK-AS1 was upregulated in NSCLC. DGUOK-AS1 silencing inhibited NSCLC cell proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis. DGUOK-AS1 was mostly expressed in cytoplasm, and positively regulated IGF2BP2. METTL3/IGF2BP2 axis could increase TRPM7 mRNA stability in m6A-dependent manner. TRPM7 overexpression reversed the inhibitive function of DGUOK-AS1 silencing on NSCLC development. DGUOK-AS1 knockdown suppressed NSCLC cell growth and metastasis in nude mice. CONCLUSION: DGUOK-AS1 silencing restrains NSCLC cell growth and metastasis through decreasing TRPM7 stability via regulation of the METTL3/IGF2BP2-mediated m6A modification.',\n","       'Astragaloside IV targets PRDX6, inhibits the activation of RAC subunit in NADPH oxidase 2 for oxidative damage.BACKGROUND: Radix Astragali Mongolici, as a traditional Chinese medicine, is widely used in the treatment of qi deficiency, viral or bacterial infection, inflammation and cancer. Astragaloside IV (AST), a key active compound in Radix Astragali Mongolici, has been shown to reduce disease progression by inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammation. However, the specific target and mechanism of action of AST in improving oxidative stress are still unclear. PURPOSE: This study aims to explore the target and mechanism of AST to improve oxidative stress, and to explain the biological process of oxidative stress. METHODS: AST functional probes were designed to capture target proteins and combined with protein spectrum to analyze target proteins. Small molecule and protein interaction technologies were used to verify the mode of action, while computer dynamics simulation technology was used to analyze the site of interaction with the target protein. The pharmacological activity of AST in improving oxidative stress was evaluated in a mouse model of acute lung injury induced by LPS. Additionally, pharmacological and serial molecular biological approaches were used to explore the underlying mechanism of action. RESULTS: AST inhibits PLA2 activity in PRDX6 by targeting the PLA2 catalytic triad pocket. This binding alters the conformation and structural stability of PRDX6 and interferes with the interaction between PRDX6 and RAC, hindering the activation of the RAC-GDI heterodimer. Inactivation of RAC prevents NOX2 maturation, attenuates superoxide anion production, and improves oxidative stress damage. CONCLUSION: The findings of this research indicate that AST impedes PLA2 activity by acting on the catalytic triad of PRDX6. This, in turn, disrupts the interaction between PRDX6 and RAC, thereby hindering the maturation of NOX2 and diminishing the oxidative stress damage.',\n","       'Berberine attenuates epithelial mesenchymal transition in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice via activating A(2a)R and mitigating the SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling.AIMS: Berberine is endowed with anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects. This study explored the role of adenosine A(2a) receptor (A(2a)R) activation and SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling suppression in the protective effects of berberine in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. MAIN METHODS: Pulmonary fibrosis was generated in mice by injecting bleomycin (40\\xa0U/kg, i.p.) on days 0, 3, 7, 10 and 14. Mice were treated with berberine (5\\xa0mg/kg, i.p.) from day 15 to day 28. KEY FINDINGS: Severe lung fibrosis and increased collagen content were observed in the bleomycin-challenged mice. Pulmonary A(2a)R downregulation was documented in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis animals and was accompanied by enhanced expression of SDF-1/CXCR4. Moreover, TGF-β1elevation and pSmad2/3 overexpression were reported in parallel with enhanced epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers expression, vimentin and α-SMA. Besides, bleomycin significantly elevated the inflammatory and pro-fibrogenic mediator NF-κB p65, TNF-α and IL-6. Furthermore, bleomycin administration induced oxidative stress as depicted by decreased Nrf2, SOD, GSH and catalase levels. Interestingly, berberine administration markedly ameliorated the fibrotic changes in lungs by modulating the purinergic system through the inhibition of A(2a)R downregulation, mitigating EMT and effectively suppressing inflammation and oxidative stress. Strikingly, A(2a)R blockade by SCH 58261, impeded the pulmonary protective effect of berberine. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings indicated that berberine could attenuate the pathological processes of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis at least partially via upregulating A(2a)R and mitigating the SDF-1/CXCR4 related pathway, suggesting A(2a)R as a potential therapeutic target for the management of pulmonary fibrosis.',\n","       'The Ethyl acetate extract from Celastrus orbiculatus suppresses non-small-cell lung cancer by activating Hippo signaling and inhibiting YAP nuclear translocation.BACKGROUND: Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb. is a medicinal plant that has been widely used for thousands of years in China, and the ethyl acetate extract (Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb. Extract, COE) from its stem was reported to exert antitumor and anti-inflammatory effects in various preclinical studies. However, the anti-non-small-cell lung cancer activity of COE and its potential mechanism are not yet fully understood. PURPOSE: To investigate the antitumor effects of COE on non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and explore its molecular mechanism from the perspective of Hippo signaling, YAP nuclear translocation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. METHODS: The effects of COE on proliferation, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, stemness, and senescence in NSCLC cell lines were determined by CCK-8, clone formation, flow cytometry, and β-galactosidase staining assays. The effects of COE on Hippo signaling were investigated by Western blotting. The intracellular expression and distribution of YAP were analyzed by immunofluorescence assay. DCFH-DA probe combined with flow cytometry was used to detect intracellular total ROS levels in NSCLC cells after COE treatment. Xenograft tumor model was established, and the animal living image system was employed to analyze the effects of COE on the Hippo-YAP signaling in vivo. RESULT: COE significantly inhibited NSCLC activity in vitro and in vivo, mainly by proliferation inhibition, cycle arrest, apoptosis promotion, senescence promotion, and stemness downregulation. COE strongly activated Hippo signaling and inhibited YAP expression and nuclear retention. Activation of Hippo signaling induced by COE was associated with ROS-mediated phosphorylation of MOB1. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that COE inhibited NSCLC through activating Hippo signaling and suppressing YAP nuclear translocation, in which ROS may play a role in the phosphorylation of the MOB1 protein.',\n","       'CAMSAP3 negatively regulates lung cancer cell invasion and angiogenesis through nucleolin/HIF-1α mRNA complex stabilization.AIMS: Cancer metastasis is a major cause of lung cancer-related mortality, so identification of related molecular mechanisms is of interest. Calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated protein 3 (CAMSAP3) has been implicated in lung cancer malignancies; however, its role in metastatic processes, including invasion and angiogenesis, is largely unknown. MAIN METHOD: The clinical relevance of CAMSAP3 expression in lung cancer was evaluated. The relevance of CAMSAP3 expression to in vitro cell invasion and angiogenesis was assessed in human lung cancer cells and endothelial cells, respectively. The molecular mechanism was identified by qRT-PCR, immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, and RNA immunoprecipitation. The in vivo metastatic and angiogenic activities of lung cancer cells were assessed. KEY FINDINGS: Low CAMSAP3 expression was found in malignant lung tissues and strongly correlated with a poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). CAMSAP3-knockout NSCLC exhibited high invasive ability, and CAMSAP3 knockout induced HUVEC proliferation and tube formation; these effects were significantly attenuated by reintroduction of exogenous wild-type CAMSAP3. Mechanistically, in the absence of CAMSAP3, the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) was upregulated, which increased the levels of downstream HIF-1α targets such as vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 2 and 9. Proteomic analysis revealed that nucleolin (NCL) bound to CAMSAP3 to regulate HIF-1α mRNA stabilization. In addition, CAMSAP3-knockout lung cancer cells displayed highly aggressive behavior in metastasis and angiogenesis in vivo. SIGNIFICANCE: This study reveals that CAMSAP3 plays a negative regulatory role in lung cancer cell metastatic behavior both in vitro and in vivo through NCL/HIF-1α mRNA complex stabilization.',\n","       'Antitumor activity and mechanisms of dual EGFR/DNA-targeting strategy for the treatment of lung cancer with EGFR(L858R/T790M) mutation.Dual inhibitor resistance and circumvent many disadvantages of combination therapy. In this work, fifteen 4-anilinoquinazoline derivatives bearing nitrogen mustard or hemi mustard moieties were designed and synthesized as dual EGFR-DNA targeting anticancer agents. Structures of target molecules were confirmed by (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and HR-MS, and evaluated for their in vitro anti-proliferative activities using MTT assay. Compound 6g emerged as the most potent derivative against mutant-type H1975 cells with IC(50) value of 1.45\\xa0μM, which exhibited 4-fold stronger potency than Chl/Gef (equimolar combination of chlorambucil and gefitinib). Kinase inhibition studies indicated that 6g showed excellent inhibitory effect on EGFR(L858R/T790M) enzyme, which was 8.6 times more effective than gefitinib. Mechanistic studies indicated that 6g induced apoptosis of H1975 cells in a dose-dependent manner and caused DNA damage. Importantly, 6g could significantly inhibit the expression of p-EGFR and its downstream p-AKT and p-ERK in H1975 cells. Molecular docking was also performed to gain insights into the ligand-binding interactions of 6g inside EGFR(WT) and EGFR(L858R/T790M) binding sites. Moreover, 6g efficiently inhibited tumor growth in the H1975 xenograft model without side effects.',\n","       'PYCR1 promotes the malignant progression of lung cancer through the JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway via PRODH-dependent glutamine synthesize.BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is a serious threat to human life. It is of great significance to elucidate the pathogenesis of lung cancer and search for new markers. This study evaluate the clinical value of pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1 (PYCR1) and explore its role and mechanisms in the malignant progression of lung cancer. METHODS: PYCR1 expression and its relationship with prognosis were analyzed using a bioinformatics database. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunohistochemistry were utilized to examine the expression of PYCR1 in lung cancer tissues and peripheral blood. PYCR1-overexpressing lung cancer cells were constructed, then the cell proliferative, migration, and invasion ability was examined by the MTT and Transwell assays. siRNA against PRODH and STAT3 inhibitor sttatic was used to further elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Luciferase and CHIP assays were carried out for validate the how PYCR1 regulated PD-L1 expression via STAT3. Xenograft experiment was performed to determine the role of PYCR1 in vivo. RESULTS: Database analysis showed that PYCR1 expression was significantly increased in lung cancer tissues, and its high expression predicted poor prognosis. Lung cancer tissue and peripheral blood of patients showed obviously increased PYCR1 expression, and the sensitivity and specificity of serum PYCR1 in the diagnosis of lung cancer were 75.7% and 60%, respectively. PYCR1 overexpression enhanced the proliferative, migration, and invasion abilities of lung cancer cells. Both PRODH silence and stattic effectively attenuated the function of PYCR1. Animal experiment and IHC data indicated that PYCR1 could activated STAT3 phosphorylation and PD-L1, as well as suppressed T cell infiltration in lung cancer. Finally, we also validated that PYCR1 promoted PD-L1 transcription by elevating STAT3 binding to the gene promoter. CONCLUSION: PYCR1 has certain value in the diagnosis and prognosis of lung cancer. Moreover, through regulating JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway, PYCR1 significantly participated in process of lung cancer progression via the metabolism link between proline and glutamine, indicating that PYCR1 might be also a novel therapeutic target.',\n","       'Exploration of novel dihydroquinoxalinone derivatives as EGFR(L858R/T790M) tyrosine kinase inhibitors for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer.To overcome or delay the drug-resistance of first-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitors and non-selectivity toxicity mediated by second-generation inhibitors, splicing principle was employed to design and synthesize a series of Osimertinib derivatives containing dihydroquinoxalinone (8-30) as the novel third-generation inhibitors against double mutant L858R/T790M in EGFR. Among them, compound 29 showed excellent kinase inhibitory activity against EGFR(L858R/T790M) with an IC(50) value of 0.55\\xa0±\\xa00.02\\xa0nM and potent anti-proliferative activity against H1975 cells with an IC(50) value of 5.88\\xa0±\\xa00.07\\xa0nM. Moreover, the strong down-regulation effect of EGFR-mediated signaling pathways and the promotion of apoptosis in H1975 cells confirmed its potent antitumor activities. Compound 29 was also demonstrated with good ADME profile in various in vitro assays. Further in vivo studies confirmed that compound 29 could suppress the growth of xenograft tumors. These results verified that compound 29 would be a promising lead compound for targeting drug-resistant EGFR mutations.',\n","       'Glycyrrhetinic acid suppresses breast cancer metastasis by inhibiting M2-like macrophage polarization via activating JNK1/2 signaling.BACKGROUND: Breast cancer metastasis is leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have been considered as potential targets for treating breast cancer metastasis because they promote tumor growth and development. Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) is one of the most important phytochemicals of licorice which has shown promising anti-cancer efficacies in pre-clinical trials. However, the regulatory effect of GA on the polarization of TAMs remains elusive. PURPOSE: To investigate the role of GA in regulating the polarization of M2 macrophages and inhibiting breast cancer metastasis, and to further explore its underlying mechanisms of action. STUDY DESIGN: IL-4 / IL-13-treated RAW 264.7 and THP-1 cells were used as the M2-polarized macrophages in vitro. A 4T1 mouse breast cancer model and the tail vein breast cancer metastasis model were applied to study the effect of GA on breast cancer growth and metastasis in vivo. RESULTS: In vitro studies showed that GA significantly inhibited IL-4 / IL 13-induced M2-like polarization in RAW 264.7 and THP-1 macrophages without affecting M1-like polarization. GA strongly decreased the expression of M2 macrophage markers CD206 and Arg-1, and reduced the levels of the pro-angiogenic molecules VEGF, MMP9, MMP2 and IL-10 in M2 macrophages. GA also increased the phosphorylation of JNK1/2 in M2 macrophages. Moreover, GA significantly suppressed M2 macrophage-induced cell proliferation and migration in 4T1 cancer cells and HUVECs. Interestingly, the inhibitory effects of GA on M2 macrophages were abolished by a JNK inhibitor. Animal studies showed that GA significantly suppressed tumor growth, angiogenesis, and lung metastasis in BALB/c mice bearing breast tumor. In tumor tissues, GA reduced the number of M2 macrophages but elevated the proportion of M1 macrophages, accompanied by activation of JNK signaling. Similar results were found in the tail vein breast cancer metastasis model. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated for the first time that GA could effectively suppress breast cancer growth and metastasis by inhibiting macrophage M2 polarization via activating JNK1/2 signaling. These findings indicate that GA could be served as the lead compound for the future development of anti-breast cancer drug.',\n","       'MTHFD1L confers a poor prognosis and malignant phenotype in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by activating the ERK5 signaling pathway.MTHFD1L, a key enzyme of folate metabolism, is seldom reported in cancer. In this study, we investigate the role of MTHFD1L in the tumorigenicity of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). ESCC tissue microarrays (TMAs) containing 177 samples from 109 patients were utilized to evaluate whether MTHFD1L expression, determined using immunohistochemical analysis, is a prognostic indicator for ESCC patients. The function of MTHFD1L in the migration and invasion of ESCC cells was studied with wound healing, Transwell, and three-dimensional spheroid invasion assays in vitro and a lung metastasis mouse model in vivo. The mRNA microarrays and Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) were used to explore the downstream of MTHFD1L. Elevated expression of MTHFD1L in ESCC tissues was significantly associated with poor differentiation and prognosis. These phenotypic assays revealed that MTHFD1L significantly promote the viability and metastasis of ESCC cell in vivo and in vitro. Further detailed analyses of the molecular mechanism demonstrated that the ESCC progression driven by MTHFD1L was through up-regulation ERK5 signaling pathways. These findings reveal that MTHFD1L is positively associated with the aggressive phenotype of ESCC by activating ERK5 signaling pathways, suggesting that MTHFD1L is a new biomarker and a potential molecular therapeutic target for ESCC.',\n","       'HOXD9 contributes to the Warburg effect and tumor metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer via transcriptional activation of PFKFB3.Warburg effect is associated with the progression of various tumors, leading to the development of drugs targeting the phenomenon. PFKFB3 is an isoform of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (PFK2) that modulates the Warburg effect and has been implicated in most common types of cancer, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the mechanisms underlying the upstream regulation of PFKFB3 in NSCLC remain poorly understood. This study reported that the transcription factor HOXD9 is upregulated in NSCLC patient samples relative to adjacent normal tissue. Elevated HOXD9 levels are primarily associated with poor prognosis in patients with NSCLC. Functionally, HOXD9 knockdown impaired the metastatic capacity of NSCLC cells, whereas its over-expression accelerated the metastasis and invasion of NSCLC cells in an orthotopic tumor mouse model. In addition, HOXD9 promoted metastasis by increasing cellular glycolysis. Further mechanistic studies revealed that HOXD9 directly binds to the promoter region of PFKFB3 to enhance its transcription. The recovery assay confirmed that the capability of HOXD9 to promote NSCLC cells metastasis was significantly weakened upon PFKFB3 inhibition. These data suggest that HOXD9 may exert as a novel biomarker in NSCLC, indicating that blocking the HOXD9/PFKFB3 axis may be a potential therapeutic strategy for NSCLC treatment.',\n","       'Sinomenine hydrochloride bidirectionally inhibits progression of tumor and autoimmune diseases by regulating AMPK pathway.BACKGROUND: Chronic diseases such as tumors and autoimmune disorders are closely linked to metabolism and immunity and require conflicting treatment methods. AMPK can regulate cell growth and inflammation through energy metabolism. Sinomenine is a compound extracted from the traditional Chinese herb sinomenium acutum (Thunb.) Rehd. et Wils. It has been used to treat NSCLC (non-small-cell lung cancer) and RA (rheumatoid arthritis) in some studies, but with limited understanding of its mechanisms. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the inhibitory effect of sinomenine hydrochloride (SH) on NSCLC and RA and to understand the underlying joint mechanisms. RESULTS: The results indicate that SH has a cytotoxic effect specifically on tumor cells, but not on normal cells. SH was found to induce cell apoptosis by activating the AMPK-mTOR pathway. Additionally, in autoimmune disease cell models, SH was shown to reduce the growth of RA-FLS cells by inhibiting the phosphorylation of AMPK, while having no effect on normal macrophages. Moreover, in vivo studies also showed that SH could reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 and slow the development of adjuvant arthritis in rats. Furthermore, SH was found to significantly suppress tumor growth in a tumor xenograft experiment in mice. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new insights into the treatment of tumors and autoimmune diseases by demonstrating that SH can selectively inhibit the growth of NSCLC cells and the progression of RA through activation of the AMPK pathway.',\n","       \"Predicting gene and protein expression levels from DNA and protein sequences with Perceiver.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The functions of an organism and its biological processes result from the expression of genes and proteins. Therefore quantifying and predicting mRNA and protein levels is a crucial aspect of scientific research. Concerning the prediction of mRNA levels, the available approaches use the sequence upstream and downstream of the Transcription Start Site (TSS) as input to neural networks. The State-of-the-art models (e.g., Xpresso and Basenjii) predict mRNA levels exploiting Convolutional (CNN) or Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Networks. However, CNN prediction depends on convolutional kernel size, and LSTM suffers from capturing long-range dependencies in the sequence. Concerning the prediction of protein levels, as far as we know, there is no model for predicting protein levels by exploiting the gene or protein sequences. METHODS: Here, we exploit a new model type (called Perceiver) for mRNA and protein level prediction, exploiting a Transformer-based architecture with an attention module to attend to long-range interactions in the sequences. In addition, the Perceiver model overcomes the quadratic complexity of the standard Transformer architectures. This work's contributions are 1. DNAPerceiver model to predict mRNA levels from the sequence upstream and downstream of the TSS; 2. ProteinPerceiver model to predict protein levels from the protein sequence; 3. Protein&DNAPerceiver model to predict protein levels from TSS and protein sequences. RESULTS: The models are evaluated on cell lines, mice, glioblastoma, and lung cancer tissues. The results show the effectiveness of the Perceiver-type models in predicting mRNA and protein levels. CONCLUSIONS: This paper presents a Perceiver architecture for mRNA and protein level prediction. In the future, inserting regulatory and epigenetic information into the model could improve mRNA and protein level predictions.

Taking surrounding anatomy into account is likely to improve the diagnostic accuracy of artificial intelligence and bring its performance closer to that of a radiologist. Therefore, we aimed to develop a deep convolutional neural network for efficient automatic anatomy segmentation of bedside CXRs. METHODS: To improve the efficiency of the segmentation process, we introduced a \"human-in-the-loop\" segmentation workflow with an active learning approach, looking at five major anatomical structures in the chest (heart, lungs, mediastinum, trachea, and clavicles). This allowed us to decrease the time needed for segmentation by 32% and select the most complex cases to utilize human expert annotators efficiently. After annotation of 2,000 CXRs from different Level 1 medical centers at Charité - University Hospital Berlin, there was no relevant improvement in model performance, and the annotation process was stopped. A 5-layer U-ResNet was trained for 150 epochs using a combined soft Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and cross-entropy as a loss function. DSC, Jaccard index (JI), Hausdorff distance (HD) in mm, and average symmetric surface distance (ASSD) in mm were used to assess model performance. External validation was performed using an independent external test dataset from Aachen University Hospital (n\\xa0=\\xa020). RESULTS: The final training, validation, and testing dataset consisted of 1900/50/50 segmentation masks for each anatomical structure. Our model achieved a mean DSC/JI/HD/ASSD of 0.93/0.88/32.1/5.8 for the lung, 0.92/0.86/21.65/4.85 for the mediastinum, 0.91/0.84/11.83/1.35 for the clavicles, 0.9/0.85/9.6/2.19 for the trachea, and 0.88/0.8/31.74/8.73 for the heart. Validation using the external dataset showed an overall robust performance of our algorithm. CONCLUSIONS: Using an efficient computer-aided segmentation method with active learning, our anatomy-based model achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art approaches. Instead of only segmenting the non-overlapping portions of the organs, as previous studies did, a closer approximation to actual anatomy is achieved by segmenting along the natural anatomical borders. This novel anatomy approach could be useful for developing pathology models for accurate and quantifiable diagnosis.',\n","       'Lifespan and medical expenditure prognosis for cancer metastasis modeling using semi-Markov process.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: A key reason of high mortality of cancers is attributed to the metastasized cancer, whereas, the medical expense for the treatment of cancer metastases generates heavily financial burden. The population size of metastases cases is small and comprehensive inferencing and prognosis is hard to conduct. METHODS: Because metastases and finance state can develop dynamic transitions over time, this study proposes a semi-Markov model to perform risk and economic evaluation associated to major cancer metastasis (i.e., lung, brain, liver and lymphoma cancer) against rare cases. A nationwide medical database in Taiwan was employed to derive a baseline study population and costs data. The time until development of metastasis and survivability from metastasis, as well as the medical costs were estimated through a semi-Markov based Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS: In terms of the survivability and risk associated to metastatic cancer patients, 80% lung and liver cancer cases are tended to metastasize to other part of the body. The highest cost is generated by brain cancer-liver metastasis patients. The survivors group generated approximately 5 times more costs, in average, than the non-survivors group. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed model provides a healthcare decision-support tool to evaluate the survivability and expenditure of major cancer metastases.',\n","       \"Molecular origins of mutational spectra produced by the environmental carcinogen N-nitrosodimethylamine and S(N)1 chemotherapeutic agents.DNA-methylating environmental carcinogens such as N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and certain alkylators used in chemotherapy form O (6)-methylguanine (m6G) as a functionally critical intermediate. NDMA is a multi-organ carcinogen found in contaminated water, polluted air, preserved foods, tobacco products, and many pharmaceuticals. Only ten weeks after exposure to NDMA, neonatally-treated mice experienced elevated mutation frequencies in liver, lung and kidney of ∼35-fold, 4-fold\\xa0and 2-fold, respectively. High-resolution mutational spectra (HRMS) of liver and lung revealed distinctive patterns dominated by GC→AT mutations in 5'-Pu-G-3' contexts, very similar to human COSMIC mutational signature SBS11. Commonly associated with alkylation damage, SBS11 appears in cancers treated with the DNA alkylator temozolomide (TMZ). When cells derived from the mice were treated with TMZ, N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, and streptozotocin (two other therapeutic methylating agents), all displayed NDMA-like HRMS, indicating mechanistically convergent mutational processes. The role of m6G in shaping the mutational spectrum of NDMA was probed by removing MGMT, the main cellular defense against m6G. MGMT-deficient mice displayed a strikingly enhanced mutant frequency, but identical HRMS, indicating that the mutational properties of these alkylators is likely owed to sequence-specific DNA binding. In sum, the HRMS of m6G-forming agents constitute an early-onset biomarker of exposure to DNA methylating carcinogens and drugs.\",\n","       'Development of certain aminoquinazoline scaffolds as potential multitarget anticancer agents with apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects: Design, synthesis and biological evaluation.Newly designed 4 11a, b, 12a, b and 13a, b) have been synthesized and evaluated for their potential multitarget anticancer activities, apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects. Thereupon, in vitro cytotoxic activities of all the synthesized compounds were screened against NCI 60 human cancer cell lines (nine subpanels) at NCI, USA. Successfully, 2-morpholino-N-(quinazolin-4-yl) acetohydrazide 5e was granted an NSC code, owing to its significant potency and broad spectrum of activity against various cancer cell lines; leukemia K-562, non-small cell lung cancer NCI-H522 cells, colon cancer SW-620, melanoma LOX IMVI, MALME-3M, renal cancer RXF 393, ACHN and breast cancer MDA-MB231/ATCC (GI% = 99.6, 161, 126.03, 90.22, 174.47, 139.7, 191 and 97, respectively). Compound 5e showed the best inhibitory activity (GI(50)\\xa0=\\xa01.3\\xa0µM) against melanoma LOX IMVI, when tested at five doses against NCI 60 cell lines. Furthermore, compound 5e showed comparable EGFR and CDK2 inhibitory activity results (IC(50)\\xa0=\\xa00.093\\xa0±\\xa00.006\\xa0μM and 0.143\\xa0±\\xa00.008\\xa0μM, respectively) to those of lapatinib and ribociclib (IC(50)\\xa0=\\xa00.03\\xa0±\\xa00.002\\xa0μM and 0.067\\xa0±\\xa00.004\\xa0μM, respectively). Western blotting analysis of compound 5e against melanoma LOX IMVI marked out significant reduced EGFR and CDK2 protein expression percentages, up to 32.97% and 34.09%, respectively, if compared to lapatinib (31.18%) and ribociclib (29.66%). Moreover, compound 5e caused clear cell cycle arrests at S phase of renal UO-31 cells and at G1 phase of both breast cancer MCF7 and ovarian cancer IGROV1, associated with remarkable increase of DNA content of the controls. In accordance, it demonstrated promising anti- proliferative and apoptotic activities, showing a significant increase in total apoptotic percentages of renal cancer UO-31, breast cancer MCF7 and ovarian IGROV1 cancer cell lines, if compared to the control untreated cells (from 1.79% to 46.72%, 2.19% to 39.02% and 1.66 to 42.51%, respectively).

Although CAR-T therapy has been trialed for treatment of GBM, the outcomes are sub-optimal possibly due to exhaustion of T cells and life-threatening neurotoxicity. To address these issues, a combined therapeutic strategy was tested in the current study using GD2 CAR-T together with Nivolumab - an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody. An effector-to-target co-culture system was established to evaluate the short-term and long-term cytotoxicity of CAR-T, as well as to investigate the inhibitory activity and T cell exhaustion associated with the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway. Orthotopic NOD/SCID GBM animal models were generated to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combined therapeutic strategy at various dosages of GD2 CAR-T with Nivolumab. GD2 CAR-T exhibited significant antigen-specific cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. The persistence of cytotoxicity of GD2 CAR-T could be enhanced by addition of Nivolumab in the co-culture system. Animal studies suggested that GD2 CAR-T effectively infiltrated into tumor tissue and significantly hampered tumor progression. The optimal therapeutic outcome was obtained via using the medium dosage of CAR-T with Nivolumab, which displayed the highest efficacy in extending the survival up to 60 days. Further investigation of toxicity revealed that high-dosage of GD2 CAR-T could induce tumor apoptosis through p53/caspase-3/PARP signaling pathway. This study suggests that GD2 CAR-T in combination with Nivolumab may offer an improved therapeutic strategy for treatment of GBM.',\n","       'Thermal ablation for primary and metastatic lung tumors: Single-center analysis of peri-procedural and intermediate-term clinical outcomes.PURPOSE: To evaluate the peri-procedural and intermediate-term clinical outcomes of thermal ablation of primary and metastatic lung cancer through analysis of a 5-year institutional experience. METHODS: In this retrospective, IRB-approved study, 55 consecutive lung ablation interventions (33 cryoablation and 22 microwave ablations) performed at an academic medical center from 2017 to 2022 were evaluated. Cryoablation was performed utilizing multiple 14-guage probes using a triple freeze/thaw protocol. Microwave ablation required a single 14-guage probe, set to 60-80 watts for 5-10\\xa0min. Lung disease distribution was 58.2\\xa0% bilateral with largest lesion size of 5.5\\xa0cm. Periprocedural outcomes including technical success and complications as well as long-term outcomes including radiographic response, objective response ratio (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and functional status were elucidated. RESULTS: Technical success rate was 100\\xa0%. The most common complication was pneumothorax which occurred in 36 (65.5\\xa0%) patients, with 27 (49.1\\xa0%) requiring chest tube placement. At 6\\xa0months, 52 (98.2\\xa0%) of the patients demonstrated a complete response and 1 patient exhibited a partial response, yielding an ORR and a DCR of 100\\xa0%. The PFS was 26\\xa0±\\xa019\\xa0months, and the OS was 90.9\\xa0%, 83.6\\xa0%, and 74.5\\xa0% at 1, 3, and 5\\xa0years, respectively. Additionally, 92.7\\xa0% (51) of patients maintained or improved their functional status (ECOG) at 6\\xa0months. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous thermal ablation techniques are evolving and promising treatments for both primary and metastatic lung tumors. Our 5-year institutional experience demonstrated their safety and efficacy with preservation of functional performance.',\n","       'Effective voltammetric tool for simultaneous detection of MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-9; important non-small cell lung cancer biomarkers.Simultaneous detection of multiple biomarkers can allow to reduce the costs of medical diagnostics, and thus improve the accuracy and effectiveness of disease diagnosis and prognosis. Here, for the first time, we present a low-cost, simple, and rapid method for simultaneous detection of three matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-9) that play important roles in the progression of lung cancer. The sensor matrix was constructed using a G2 polyamidoamine dendrimer (PAMAM) containing amino, carboxyl, and sulfhydryl groups. The recognition process was based on specific enzymatic cleavage of the Gly-Ile peptide bond by MMP-1, Gly-Leu bond by MMP-2, and Gly-Met bond by MMP-9, and monitoring was done by square wave voltammetry. The activity of metalloproteinases was detected based on the change of current signals of redox receptors (dipeptides labeled with electroactive compounds) covalently anchored onto the electrode surface. The conditions of the biosensor construction, including the concentration of receptors on the sensor surface and the time of interaction of the receptor with the analyte, were carefully optimized. Under optimal conditions, the linear response of the developed method ranged from 1.0⋅10(-8) to 1.0\\xa0mg⋅L(-1), and the limit of detection for MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-9 was 0.35, 0.62, and 1.10\\xa0fg⋅mL(-1), respectively. The constructed biosensor enabled us to efficiently profile the levels of active forms of MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-9 in tissue samples (plasma and lung and tumor extracts). Thus, the developed biosensor can aid in the early detection and diagnosis of lung cancer.',\n","       'Racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in trajectories of morbidity accumulation among older Americans.INTRODUCTION: Multimorbidity, the presence of multiple chronic health conditions, generally starts in middle and older age but there is considerable heterogeneity in the trajectory of morbidity accumulation. This study aimed to clarify the number of distinct trajectories and the potential associations between race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status and these trajectories. METHODS: Data from 13,699 respondents (age ≥51) in the Health and Retirement Study between 1998 and 2016 were analyzed with growth mixture models. Nine prevalent self-reported morbidities (arthritis, cancer, cognitive impairment, depressive symptoms, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, lung disease, stroke) were summed for the morbidity count. RESULTS: Three trajectories of morbidity accumulation were identified: low [starting with few morbidities and accumulating them slowly (i.e., low intercept and low slope); 80% of sample], increasing (i.e., low intercept and high slope; 9%), and high (i.e., high intercept and low slope; 11%). Compared to non-Hispanic (NH) White adults in covariate-adjusted models, NH Black adults had disadvantages while Hispanic adults had advantages. Our results suggest a protective effect of education for NH Black adults (i.e., racial health disparities observed at low education were ameliorated and then eliminated at increasing levels of education) and a reverse pattern for Hispanic adults (i.e., increasing levels of education was found to dampen the advantages Hispanic adults had at low education). Compared with NH White adults, higher levels of wealth were protective for both NH Black adults (i.e., reducing or reversing racial health disparities observed at low wealth) and Hispanic adults (i.e., increasing the initial health advantages observed at low wealth). CONCLUSION: These findings have implications for addressing health disparities through more precise targeting of public health interventions. This work highlights the imperative to address socioeconomic inequalities that interact with race/ethnicity in complex ways to erode health.',\n","       'Efficacy of zoledronic acid for the elimination of disseminated tumor cells in a clinically relevant, spontaneously metastatic prostate cancer xenograft model.Bone metastases develop in >90\\xa0% of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (PCa) through complex interactions between the bone microenvironment and tumor cells. Previous androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), which is known to cause bone loss, as well as anti-resorptive agents such as zoledronic acid (ZA), used to prevent skeletal complications, may influence these interactions and thereby the growth of disseminated tumor cells (DTC) in the bone marrow (BM). Here, a spontaneously metastatic xenograft tumor model of human PCa was further optimized to mimic the common clinical situation of ADT (castration) combined with primary tumor resection in vivo. The effects of these interventions, alone or in combination with ZA treatment, on tumor cell dissemination to the BM and other distant sites were analyzed. Metastatic burden was quantified by human-specific Alu-qPCR, bioluminescence imaging (BLI), and immunohistochemistry. Further, bone remodeling was assessed by static histomorphometry and serum parameters. Initial comparative analysis between NSG and SCID mice showed that spontaneous systemic dissemination of subcutaneous PC-3 xenograft tumors was considerably enhanced in NSG mice. Primary tumor resection and thereby prolonged observational periods resulted in a higher overall metastatic cell load at necropsy and tumor growth alone caused significant bone loss, which was further augmented by surgical castration. In addition, castrated mice showed a strong trend towards higher bone metastasis loads. Weekly treatment of mice with ZA completely prevented castration- and tumor-induced bone loss but had no effect on bone metastasis burden. Conversely, the total lung metastasis load as determined by BLI was significantly decreased upon ZA treatment. These findings provide a basis for future research on the role of ZA not only in preventing skeletal complications but also in reducing metastasis to other organs.',\n","       'What are the indications and survivorship of tumor endoprosthetic reconstructions for patients with extremity metastatic bone disease?BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Given advances in therapies, endoprosthetic reconstruction (EPR) in metastatic bone disease (MBD) may be increasingly indicated. The objectives were to review the indications, and implant and patient survivorship in patients undergoing EPR for MBD. METHODS: A review of patients undergoing EPR for extremity MBD between 1992 and 2022 at two centers was performed. Surgical data, implant survival, patient survival, and implant failure modes were examined. RESULTS: One hundred fifteen patients were included with a median follow-up of 14.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 9.2-19.3) and survival of 19.4 months (95% CI: 13.6-26.1). The most common diagnosis was renal cell carcinoma (34/115, 29.6%) and the most common location was proximal femur (43/115, 37.4%). Indications included: actualized fracture (58/115, 50.4%), impending fracture (30/115, 26.1%), and failed fixation (27/115, 23.5%). Implant failure was uncommon (10/115, 8.7%). Patients undergoing EPR for failed fixation were more likely to have renal or lung cancer (p\\u2009=\\u20090.006). CONCLUSIONS: EPRs were performed most frequently for renal cell carcinoma and in patients with a relatively favorable survival. EPR was indicated for failed previous fixation in 23.5% of cases, emphasizing the importance of predictive survival modeling. EPR can be a reliable and durable surgical option for patients with MBD.',\n","       \"Rhabdomyosarcoma with isolated lung metastases: A report from the Soft Tissue Sarcoma Committee of the Children's Oncology Group.BACKGROUND: To determine outcomes of children with rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) with isolated lung metastases. METHODS: Data were analyzed for 428 patients with metastatic RMS treated on COG protocols. Categorical variables were compared using Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests. Event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. RESULTS: Compared with patients with other metastatic sites (n\\xa0=\\xa0373), patients with lung-only metastases (n\\xa0=\\xa055) were more likely to be <10 years of age, have embryonal histology (embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma), have N0 disease, and less likely to have primary extremity tumors. Lung-only patients had significantly better survival outcomes than patients with all other sites of metastatic disease (p\\xa0<\\xa0.0001) with 5-year EFS of 48.1 versus 18.8% and 5-year OS of 64.1 versus 26.9%. Patients with lung-only metastases, and those with a single extrapulmonary site of metastasis, had better survival compared with patients with two or more sites of metastatic disease (p\\xa0<\\xa0.0001). In patients with ERMS and lung-only metastases, there was no significant difference in survival between patients ≥10 years and 1-9 years (5-year EFS: 58.3 vs. 68.2%, 5-year OS: 66.7 vs. 67.7%). CONCLUSIONS: With aggressive treatment, patients with ERMS and lung-only metastatic disease have superior EFS and OS compared with patients with other sites of metastatic disease, even when older than 10 years of age. Consideration should be given to including patients ≥10 years with ERMS and lung-only metastases in the same group as those <10 years in future risk stratification algorithms.\",\n","       'Efficacy of a growth hormone-releasing hormone agonist in a murine model of cardiometabolic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) represents a major unmet medical need owing to its diverse pathophysiology and lack of effective therapies. Potent synthetic, agonists (MR-356 and MR-409) of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) improve the phenotype of models of HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and in cardiorenal models of HFpEF. Endogenous GHRH exhibits a broad range of regulatory influences in the cardiovascular (CV) system and aging and plays a role in several cardiometabolic conditions including obesity and diabetes. Whether agonists of GHRH can improve the phenotype of cardiometabolic HFpEF remains untested and unknown. Here we tested the hypothesis that MR-356 can mitigate/reverse the cardiometabolic HFpEF phenotype. C57BL6N mice received a high-fat diet (HFD) plus the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (l-NAME) for 9 wk. After 5 wk of HFD + l-NAME regimen, animals were randomized to receive daily injections of MR-356 or placebo during a 4-wk period. Control animals received no HFD + l-NAME or agonist treatment. Our results showed the unique potential of MR-356 to treat several HFpEF-like features including cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, capillary rarefaction, and pulmonary congestion. MR-356 improved cardiac performance by improving diastolic function, global longitudinal strain (GLS), and exercise capacity. Importantly, the increased expression of cardiac pro-brain natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) was restored to normal levels suggesting that MR-356 reduced myocardial stress associated with metabolic inflammation in HFpEF. Thus, agonists of GHRH may be an effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cardiometabolic HFpEF phenotype.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This randomized study used rigorous hemodynamic tools to test the efficacy of a synthetic GHRH agonist to improve cardiac performance in a cardiometabolic HFpEF. Daily injection of the GHRH agonist, MR-356, reduced the HFpEF-like effects as evidenced by improved diastolic dysfunction, reduced cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and pulmonary congestion. Notably, end-diastolic pressure and end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship were reset to control levels. Moreover, treatment with MR-356 increased exercise capacity and reduced myocardial stress associated with metabolic inflammation in HFpEF.',\n","       'Spirituality and Hope Levels of Lung Cancer Patients Who Had Surgery in Turkey.This study explores the relationship between spirituality and hope levels in lung cancer patients.

Particulate matter (PM) and PM-bound trace elements and bacteria were examined to determine the chemical and biological hazards associated with AD days and compared with non-AD\\xa0days in Seoul. On AD days, the mean PM10 concentration was ∼3.5 times higher than that on non-AD\\xa0days. Elements generated from the Earth\\'s crust (Al, Fe, and Ca) and anthropogenic sources (Pb, Ni, and Cd) were identified as major contributors to coarse and fine particles, respectively. During AD days, the study area was recognized as \"severe\" for pollution index and pollution load index levels, and \"moderately to heavily polluted\" for geoaccumulation index levels. The potential cancer risk (CR) and non-CR were estimated for the dust generated during AD events. On AD days, total CR levels were significant (in 1.08\\xa0×\\xa010(-5)-2.22\\xa0×\\xa010(-5)), which were associated with PM-bound As, Cd, and Ni. In addition, inhalation CR was found to be similar to the incremental lifetime CR levels estimated using the human respiratory tract mass deposition model. In a short exposure duration (14 days), high PM and bacterial mass deposition, significant non-CR levels, and a high presence of potential respiratory infection-causing pathogens (Rothia mucilaginosa) were observed during AD days. Significant non-CR levels were observed for bacterial exposure, despite insignificant levels of PM10-bound elements. Therefore, the substantial ecological risk, CR, and non-CR levels for inhalation exposure to PM-bound bacteria, and the presence of potential respiratory pathogens, indicate that AD events pose a significant risk to both human lung health and the environment. This study provides the first comprehensive examination of significant non-CR levels for bacteria and carcinogenicity of PM-bound metals during AD events.',\n","       'A robust lyophilized kit for convenient one-step formulation of [(68)Ga]Ga-DOTA-E-[c(RGDfK)](2) in hospital radiopharmacy for clinical PET imaging.The present article describes the development of robust lyophilized kit for convenient formulation of [(68)Ga]Ga-DOTA-E-[c(RGDfK)](2) (E\\xa0=\\xa0glutamic acid, R = arginine, G = glycine, D = aspartic acid, f\\xa0=\\xa0phenylalanine, K\\xa0=\\xa0lysine) radiopharmaceutical for clinical use in non-invasive monitoring of malignancies overexpressing integrin α(v)β(3) receptors.

Our experience on 103 cases.BACKGROUND: Brain metastases (BM) occur in the natural course of malignant tumors in 18-40% of cases. Their management has changed considerably over the past decade thanks to the advent of Gamma knife Stereotactic Radiosurgery (GKSR). OBJECTIVE: We report our experience on Single Brain metastasis treated with (GKSR). METHODS: Patients treated by Gamma Knife stereotaxic radiosurgery (GKSR) in our institution between 2009 and 2021 for Single BM were recorded retrospectively. RESULTS: A total of 103 patients (n\\xa0=\\xa052; 50.5% females) were included, with a mean age of 56.33\\xa0±\\xa011.33. Breast (n\\xa0=\\xa039, 37.9%) and lung (n\\xa0=\\xa036, 35%) were the common original location for the primary tumors. GKSR alone without prior surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy was achieved in 81.5% (n\\xa0=\\xa084). Thirteen patients (15.1%) progressed in BM volume while finding the appearance of de novo BM in 5 (5.8%) patients.

Historically, these processes typically required single-gene sequencing, next-generation sequencing, or visual inspection of histopathology slides by experienced pathologists in a clinical context. In the past decade, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have demonstrated remarkable potential in assisting physicians with accurate diagnosis of oncology image-recognition tasks. Meanwhile, AI techniques make it possible to integrate multimodal data such as radiology, histology, and genomics, providing critical guidance for the stratification of patients in the context of precision therapy. Given that the mutation detection is unaffordable and time-consuming for a considerable number of patients, predicting gene mutations based on routine clinical radiological scans or whole-slide images of tissue with AI-based methods has become a hot issue in actual clinical practice. In this review, we synthesized the general framework of multimodal integration (MMI) for molecular intelligent diagnostics beyond standard techniques. Then we summarized the emerging applications of AI in the prediction of mutational and molecular profiles of common cancers (lung, brain, breast, and other tumor types) pertaining to radiology and histology imaging. Furthermore, we concluded that there truly exist multiple challenges of AI techniques in the way of its real-world application in the medical field, including data curation, feature fusion, model interpretability, and practice regulations. Despite these challenges, we still prospect the clinical implementation of AI as a highly potential decision-support tool to aid oncologists in future cancer treatment management.',\n","       'Estimating stage-specific sensitivity for cancer screening tests.OBJECTIVES: When evaluating potential new cancer screening modalities, estimating sensitivity, especially for early-stage cases, is critical. There are methods to approximate stage-specific sensitivity in asymptomatic populations, both in the prospective (active screening) and retrospective (stored specimens) scenarios. We explored their validity via a simulation study. METHODS: We fit natural history models to lung and ovarian cancer screening data that permitted estimation of stage-specific (early/late) true sensitivity, defined as the probability subjects screened in the given stage had positive tests. We then ran simulations, using the fitted models, of the prospective and retrospective scenarios. Prospective sensitivity by stage was estimated as screen-detected divided by screen-plus interval-detected cancers, where stage is defined as stage at detection. Retrospective sensitivity by stage was estimated based on cancers detected within specified windows before clinical diagnosis with stage defined as stage at clinical diagnosis. RESULTS: Stage-specific true sensitivities estimated by the lung cancer natural history model were 47% (early) and 63% (late). Simulation results for the prospective setting gave estimated sensitivities of 81% (early) versus 62% (late). In the retrospective scenario, early/late sensitivity estimates were 35%/57% (1-year window) and 27%/49% (2-year window). In the prospective scenario, most subjects with negative early-stage screens presented as other than early-stage interval cases. Results were similar for ovarian cancer, with estimated prospective sensitivity much greater than true sensitivity for early stage, 84% versus 25%. CONCLUSIONS: Existing methods for approximating stage-specific sensitivity in both prospective and retrospective scenarios are unsatisfactory; improvements are needed before they can be considered to be reliable.',\n","       'CircRNA circ_POLA2 overexpression suppresses cell apoptosis by downregulating PTEN in glioblastoma.The oncogenic role of circ_POLA2 has only been explored in lung cancer, whereas the role of which in glioblastoma (GBM) is unclear. Our research explored the involvement of circ_POLA2 in GBM. Circ_POLA2 and phosphatasetensinhomolog (PTEN) mRNA levels in GBM and paired nontumor tissues collected from 58 GBM patients were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Circ_POLA2 and PTEN were overexpressed in GBM cells to study their interaction by RT-qPCR and Western blot. The roles of circ_POLA2 and PTEN in regulating GBM cell apoptosis were explored using cell apoptosis assay. Our data revealed that circ_POLA2 was upregulated and PTEN was downregulated in GBM. PTEN showed an inverse correlation to circ_POLA2 across GBM tissues, In GBM cells, circ_POLA2 overexpression decreased PTEN accumulation, but PTEN overexpression failed to significantly affect circ_POLA2 expression. Moreover, PTEN reduced the inhibitory effects of circ_POLA2 on GBM cell apoptosis. Circ_POLA2 is overexpressed in MCL and might promote GBM cell apoptosis through downregulating PTEN.',\n","       'Neoadjuvant target therapy with ensartinib in lung adenocarcinoma with EML4-ALK fusion variant: a case report and literature review.Although neoadjuvant target therapy has been used to treat patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), most of these patients have mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene. Few patients to date have received neoadjuvant target therapy for NSCLC containing variants in genes encoding anaplastic lymphoma kinase-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ALK-TKIs). Herein, we present a 51-year-old man with a lung mass in the left lower lobe with enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. He was diagnosed with NSCLC after needle lung biopsy, with next-generation sequencing showing an echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 gene-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4-ALK) fusion variant.

Trends in surgical treatment for cancer during the pandemic have not been well described. We sought to characterize associations between the pandemic and access to surgical treatment for breast, colorectal, and lung cancer in Illinois. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study evaluating inpatient admissions at Illinois hospitals providing surgical care for lung cancer (n\\xa0=\\xa01913 cases, n\\xa0=\\xa064 hospitals), breast cancer (n\\xa0=\\xa0910 cases, n\\xa0=\\xa0108 hospitals), and colorectal cancer (n\\xa0=\\xa05339 cases, n\\xa0=\\xa0144 hospitals). Using discharge data from the Illinois Health and Hospital Association's Comparative Health Care and Hospital Data Reporting Services database, average monthly surgical case volumes were compared from 2019 to 2020. We also compared rates of cancer surgery for each cancer type, by patient characteristics, and hospital type across the three time periods using Pearson chi-squared and ANOVA testing as appropriate. Three discrete time periods were considered: prepandemic (7-12/2019), primary pandemic (4-6/2020), and pandemic recovery (7-12/2020). Hospital characteristics evaluated included hospital type (academic, community, safety net), COVID-19 burden, and baseline cancer surgery volume. RESULTS: There were 2096 fewer operations performed for breast, colorectal, and lung cancer in 2020 than 2019 in Illinois, with the greatest reductions in cancer surgery volume occurring at the onset of the pandemic in April (colorectal, -48.3%; lung, -13.1%) and May (breast, -45.2%) of 2020. During the pandemic, breast (-14.6%) and colorectal (-13.8%) cancer surgery experienced reductions in volume whereas lung cancer operations were more common (+26.4%) compared to 2019. There were no significant differences noted in gender, race, ethnicity, or insurance status among patients receiving oncologic surgery during the primary pandemic or pandemic recovery periods. Academic hospitals, hospitals with larger numbers of COVID-19 admissions, and those with greater baseline cancer surgery volumes were associated with the greatest reduction in cancer surgery during the primary pandemic period (all cancer types, P\\xa0<\\xa00.01). During the recovery period, hospitals with greater baseline breast and lung cancer surgery volumes remained at reduced surgery volumes compared to their counterparts (P\\xa0<\\xa00.01). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with significant reductions in breast and colorectal cancer operations in Illinois, while lung cancer operations remained relatively consistent. Overall, there was a net reduction in cancer surgery that was not made up during the recovery period. Academic hospitals, those caring for more COVID-19 patients, and those with greater baseline surgery volumes were most vulnerable to reduced surgery rates during peaks of the pandemic and to delays in addressing the backlog of cases.\",\n","       'Exploration of immunotherapy in advanced pulmonary lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma.Pulmonary lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (PLELC) is a rare and histologically distinctive subtype of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). High expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and scarcity of druggable driver mutations raise the potential of immunotherapy for advanced PELEC. However, evidence on the clinical impact of immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) remained limited and unconvincing. The present study retrospectively enrolled advanced PLELC patients who received ICIs either as up-front or salvage therapy in SYSUCC between March 15, 2017 and March 15, 2022. The comparative efficacy of chemoimmunotherapy vs chemotherapy in the first-line setting and chemoimmunotherapy vs ICIs monotherapy in the ≥2 line setting was investigated. A total of 96 patients were finally enrolled; 49 PLELC patients received immunotherapy plus platinum-based chemotherapy, while 45 patients received platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line treatment. Patients with chemoimmunotherapy significantly obtain more survival benefits than those receiving chemotherapy (median progression-free survival [PFS]: 15.6 vs 8.6\\xa0months, P\\xa0=\\xa0.0015). Additionally, patients with chemoimmunotherapy obtained more PFS benefits than those with ICIs monotherapy in the ≥2 line of therapy (median PFS: 21.7\\xa0months vs 7.8\\xa0months, P\\xa0=\\xa0.094). A significant correlation was observed between prognostic nutritional index (PNI) and favorable treatment outcomes in patients receiving first-line chemoimmunotherapy (median PFS: 17.8\\xa0months vs 7.6\\xa0months, P\\u2009<\\u2009.0001). Likewise, patients in the monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR)-high group had significantly shorter PFS than the MLR-low group (median PFS: 11.2\\xa0months vs not reached, P\\xa0=\\xa0.0009). Our study elucidated the superior efficacy of ICIs therapy, especially chemoimmunotherapy in advanced PLELC, which may provide new insight into the role of immunotherapy in advanced PLELC.',\n","       'CircRNA B cell linker regulates cisplatin sensitivity in nonsmall cell lung cancer via microRNA-25-3p/BarH‑like homeobox 2 axis.Cisplatin (DDP) was a commonly used drug in the treatment of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the current resistance of patients to DDP seriously affected its therapeutic effect. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been reported to regulate drug resistance in cells. The purpose of this paper is to study the effect of circRNA B cell linker (circ_BLNK) in DDP resistance of NSCLC. The abundances of circ_BLNK, microRNA-25-3p (miR-25-3p) and BarH‑like homeobox 2 (BARX2) were examined by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot analysis. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide assay, EdU assay and flow cytometry. Transwell assay was applied to assess cell migration and invasion. Protein levels were quantified by western blot analysis. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was enforced to confirm the links among circ_BLNK, miR-25-3p and BARX2. The mice models were enforced to evaluate tumorigenicity. Herein, circ_BLNK and BARX2 were lower-expressed, whereas miR-25-3p was higher-expressed in A549/DDP and H1299/DDP cells than their homologous parental NSCLC cells. Circ_BLNK increases improved DDP sensitivity of NSCLC cells by promoting cell apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation, migration and invasion. Moreover, we confirmed that circ_BLNK regulated BARX2 by inhibiting miR-25-3p. Accordingly, overexpression of circ_BLNK improved DDP sensitivity of NSCLC cells via miR-25-3p/BARX2 axis. Besides, circ_BLNK reduced cell resistance to DDP, thereby inhibiting tumor development in mice. Circ_BLNK promoted the DDP sensitivity of NSCLC via regulating miR-25-3p/BARX2 axis.',\n","       'Extracellular vesicles as personalized medicine.Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released from all cells in the body, forming an important intercellular communication network that contributes to health and disease. The contents of EVs are cell source-specific, inducing distinct signaling responses in recipient cells. The specificity of EVs and their accumulation in fluid spaces that are accessible for liquid biopsies make them highly attractive as potential biomarkers and therapies for disease. The duality of EVs as favorable (therapeutic) or unfavorable (pathological) messengers is context dependent and remains to be fully determined in homeostasis and various disease states. This review describes the use of EVs as biomarkers, drug delivery vehicles, and regenerative therapeutics, highlighting examples involving viral infections, cancer, and neurological diseases. There is growing interest to provide personalized therapy based on individual patient and disease characteristics. Increasing evidence suggests that EV biomarkers and therapeutic approaches are ideal for personalized medicine due to the diversity and multifunctionality of EVs.',\n","       'Extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer: Current management and future directions.Extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) is regarded as a refractory carcinoma associated with extremely rapid disease progression. After more than three decades without clinical advances, research on immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) combined with platinum-based chemotherapy has led to the first treatment breakthrough, establishing a new standard for the first-line treatment of ES-SCLC. Further studies have extensively evaluated small-molecule antiangiogenic drugs, PARP inhibitors, as well as lurbinectedin in SCLC and have demonstrated some benefit, although no breakthroughs have been made. In addition, newer therapeutic strategies with targeted agents, novel chemotherapeutics and immunotherapies are evolving as they are being actively explored and hold promise for patients with this disease. Notably, the preliminary identification of SCLC molecular subtypes driven by the expression of dominant transcription factors with RNA sequencing profiles has made it possible to identify molecularly tailored therapeutic approaches, which increases the potential for individualized precision treatment of SCLC. In this review, we summarize recent research advances in ES-SCLC, outline the current management of this disease and reflect on directions for future development.',\n","       'Heterozygous germline FLCN mutation in Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome with bilateral renal hybrid oncocytic/chromophobe tumor and unilateral renal chromophobe cell carcinoma: a case report.BACKGROUND: Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant tumor syndrome caused by Folliculin (FLCN) gene mutation. The clinical manifestations are diverse, and the renal tumor is the most serious. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 51-year-old female with multiple space-occupying lesions in both kidneys, as well as bilateral renal cysts and multiple lung cysts. The resected tumors were finally diagnosed as bilateral renal hybrid oncocytic/chromophobe tumor (HOCT) and unilateral chromophobe cell carcinoma. A history of pneumothorax surgery 4 years ago was convinced. All of these strongly suggested the possibility of BHD syndrome. Gene test confirmed a heterozygous germline FLCN nonsense mutation (c.1429C\\u2009>\\u2009T, p.Arg477Ter). The patient is still doing well after 20\\xa0months of follow-up (cut-off date July 2022). CONCLUSION: This is a case of BHD syndrome presented with bilateral renal tumor, renal cysts, and multiple lung cysts, and confirmed by gene testing. Patients with any combination of one or more of the manifestations should remain\\xa0alert\\xa0to the BHD syndrome.

Our goal was to investigate how different CD44 isoforms contribute to the emergence of stem cell (SC) overpopulation that drives colorectal cancer (CRC) development. Specific CD44 variant isoforms are selectively expressed in normal colonic SCs and become overexpressed in CRCs during tumor development. We created a unique panel of anti-CD44 rabbit genomic antibodies to 16 specific epitopes that span the entire length of the CD44 molecule. Our panel was used to comprehensively investigate the expression of different CD44 isoforms in matched pairs (n\\u2009=\\u200910) of malignant colonic tissue and adjacent normal mucosa, using two (IHC & IF) immunostaining approaches. We found that: i) CD44v8-10 is selectively expressed in the normal human colonic SC niche; ii) CD44v8-10 is co-expressed with the SC markers ALDH1 and LGR5 in normal and malignant colon tissues; iii) colon carcinoma tissues frequently (80%) stain for CD44v8-10 while staining for CD44v6 was less frequent (40%). Given that CD44v8-10 expression is restricted to cells in the normal human colonic SC niche and CD44v8-10 expression progressively increases during CRC development, CD44v8-10 expression likely contributes to the SC overpopulation that drives the development and growth of colon cancers. Since the CD44 variant v8-10 epitope is located on CD44's extracellular region, it offers great promise for targeted anti-CSC treatment approaches.\",\n","       'Colon adenocarcinoma and Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome in a young patient: case report and exploration of pathologic implications.Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome (BHD) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by germline mutations in the folliculin gene (FLCN) that result in the functional loss of the tumor suppressor folliculin. It is classically associated with cutaneous hamartomas, pulmonary cysts with spontaneous pneumothorax, and various renal cancers. In this case, we present a patient initially diagnosed with chromophobe renal cell carcinoma and subsequently found to have colorectal cancer (CRC). The presence of two separate malignancies in a young patient with a strong family history of CRC (father and paternal grandfather) led to genetic testing, which revealed an FLCN c.1177-5_1177-3del mutation, and a diagnosis of BHD was made. Out of the more than 300 known unique mutations of the FLCN coding region, the c.1285dupC mutation on exon 11 has been the only one convincingly associated with CRC thus far. While larger cohort studies are needed to further clarify this association, we present the first patient with CRC to our knowledge with an FLCN c.1177-5_1177-3del mutation and loss of heterozygosity implicating it as an initiating factor in tumorigenesis. We further explore the studies supporting and refuting the connection between BHD and CRC and highlight the molecular signaling pathways that may play a role in pathogenesis.',\n","       'Barriers and recommendations for colorectal cancer screening in Africa.BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide. The incidence of CRC is rising in low- and middle-income countries but decreasing in high-income countries due to the widespread use of surveillance colonoscopy. In Africa, the implementation of screening programs remains a challenge, even in countries, such as Ghana that have established CRC screening guidelines. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review was to identify the barriers and recommend strategies for implementing CRC screening in African countries. METHODS: A literature search using PubMed was conducted with the following search terms: colorectal neoplasm, early detection of cancer, mass screening, colonoscopy, faecal occult blood test, faecal immunochemical test (FIT) and Africa. After inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, a total of 13 articles were reviewed. RESULTS: The most common barriers reported were limited endoscopic capacity, poor knowledge of CRC and CRC screening, health care factors, cultural factors and sociodemographic factors. Recommendations to increase the availability of CRC screening tests were to include the use of FITs, to provide more training for health care providers, and to expand educational programs for patients, physicians, and religious/community leaders. CONCLUSION: The primary barrier to screening for CRC in Africa is the limited endoscopic capacity, specifically the lack of infrastructure and trained personnel, which requires systematic changes by governing bodies. In addition, health care professionals should be involved in educating patients about CRC and CRC screening. Further research is needed to clarify the factors related to subtypes of CRC and to explore the feasibility of using FITs in Africa.',\n","       'Dostarlimab: From preclinical investigation to drug approval and future directions.Immune checkpoint blockers (ICB) act by reverting the immunosuppressive phenotype of cancer cells, thus allowing host immune system to generate an immune response to the tumor. One of the key mechanisms targeted by ICB is the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, which lies onto the interaction between the programmed-cell death protein 1 and its ligand, overexpressed in several tumor types. This interaction leads to the inhibition of T-cell proliferation and their apoptosis and exhaustion. Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies are now the mainstay of treatment for several advanced stage tumors. Dostarlimab is a novel IgG4 anti-PD-1 antibody which has yielded remarkable results in mismatch-repair deficient endometrial cancer and locally advanced rectal cancer.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the antimetastatic effect and underlying molecular mechanisms of SAG on melanoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CCK8 assay was used to determine the inhibition of SAG on the proliferation of A375 and A2058 cells. Network pharmacology analysis was applied to construct a compound-target network and select potential therapeutic targets of SAG against melanoma.

RNA acetylation modifications are gradually expanding in oncology. However, the role of RNA acetylation modifications in colorectal cancer and its association with colorectal cancer microsatellite status remain unclear. Using public databases and in vitro experiments, we verified the expression and biological function of NAT10, as the key RNA acetylation modification enzyme, in colorectal cancer. The results showed that NAT10 was highly expressed in colorectal cancer, and significantly promoted colorectal cancer cell proliferation. NAT10 was also involved in several aspects of cell homoeostasis such as ion transport, calcium-dependent phospholipid binding, and RNA stability. NAT10 expression positively correlated with immune infiltration in colorectal cancer. We further constructed a risk regression model for mRNA acetylation in colorectal cancer using acetylation-related differential genes. We found that tumour immune infiltration, microsatellite instability (MSI) proportion, tumour immune mutation burden, and patient response to immunotherapy were positively correlated with risk scores. For the first time, our study showed that the level of mRNA acetylation modification level is elevated in colorectal cancer and positively correlates with immune infiltration and microsatellite status of patients.

Monensin has represented anti-cancer effect on various human cancer cells. We seek to investigate the effect of monensin on proliferation of human colorectal cancer cells and explore whether IGF1R signaling pathway is involved in anti-cancer mechanism of monensin. METHODS: Cell proliferation and migration were assessed by crystal violet staining and cell wounding assay respectively. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by Hoechst 33258 staining and flow cytometry. Cell cycle progression was detected with the use of flow cytometry. Cancer-associated pathways were assessed with the use of pathway-specific reporters. Gene expression was detected by touchdown-quantitative real-time PCR. Inhibition of IGF1R was tested by immunofluorescence staining. Inhibition of IGF1R signaling was accomplished by adenovirus-mediated expression of IGF1. RESULTS: We found that monensin not only effectively inhibited cell proliferation, cell migration as well as cell cycle progression, but also induced apoptosis and G1 arrest in human colorectal cancer cells. Monensin was shown to target multiple cancer-related signaling pathways such as Elk1, AP1, as well as Myc/max, and suppressed IGF1R expression via increasing IGF1 in colorectal cancer cells. CONCLUSION: Monensin could suppressed IGF1R expression via increasing IGF1 in colorectal cancer cells. It has the potential to be repurposed as an anti-colorectal cancer agent, but further studies are still required to investigate the detailed mechanisms of monensin underlying its anti-cancer motion.Key MessagesMonensin inhibits the cell proliferation and the migration, induces apoptosis and inhibits cell cycle progression in human colorectal cancer cells.Monensin may exert anti-cancer activity by targeting multiple signaling pathways, including the IGF1R signaling pathway.Monensin has the potential to be repurposed as an anti-colorectal cancer agent.',\n","       'Curative en bloc resection of a laterally spreading mixed-nodular papillary tumor with endoscopic submucosal dissection: a case report.nan',\n","       'Bioinformatic analysis of the clinicopathological and prognostic significance of oocyte-arresting BTG4 mRNA expression in gynecological cancers.BTG4 arrests the cell cycle and suppresses oocyte and embryonic development.

BTG4 expression was downregulated in breast cancer compared with normal tissues (p\\u2009<\\u2009.05), but the opposite was observed in cervical, endometrial and ovarian cancers (p\\u2009<\\u2009.05). BTG4 methylation was negatively correlated with its mRNA expression in breast, cervical and endometrial cancers (p\\u2009<\\u2009.05). BTG4 mRNA expression was negatively correlated with T staging and distant metastasis of breast cancer; and with tumor invasion, clinical stage, low weight and BMI, low histological grade and no diabetes in endometrial cancer but positively with T stage and non-keratinizing squamous carcinoma in endometrial cancer. BTG4 expression was negatively correlated with the survival of ovarian cancer patients (p\\u2009<\\u2009.05), but positively for breast, cervical and endometrial cancers (p\\u2009<\\u2009.05). BTG4 expression is thus a potential marker reflecting the carcinogenesis, aggressiveness and prognosis in gynecological cancers.Impact StatementWhat is already known on this subject? Previous studies have revealed the structure and location of BTG4. BTG4 inhibit cell proliferative, promote apoptosis, induce G1 cell cycle arrest. BTG4 promotes the development of mouse embryos from cell stage 1 to 2. The methylation and biological function of BTG4 were clarified in gastric and/or colorectal cancer cells.What do the results of this study add? BTG4 is found to closely link to reflect the carcinogenesis, histogenesis, aggressive behaviors and prognosis of gynecological cancers, and involved in ligand-receptor interaction, microtubule motor activity, dynein light chain binding, cilium organization, assembly, and movement in endometrial and ovarian cancers.What are the implications of these finding for clinical practice and/or further research?

The underlying mechanism involves the suppression of the Yes-associated protein. However, the specific role of LAF in cell cycle regulation remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study determined the molecular mechanism by which LAF regulates cell cycle progression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Various colon cancer cell lines (SW480, HCT15, and HCT116) were treated with LAF (25, 50, and 75\\u2009μmol/L) for 48\\u2009h. The effects of LAF on cell proliferation and cell cycle were determined using sulforhodamine B and flow cytometry assays. Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified using quantitative proteomics. Bioinformatic analysis of DEPs was conducted via Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. Expression levels of DEPs in the cell cycle pathway were analyzed using RT-qPCR and western blotting. RESULTS: LAF suppressed the proliferation of SW480, HCT15, and HCT116 cells (IC(50) 47.1, 51.4, and 32.8\\u2009μmol/L, respectively) and induced cell cycle arrest at the S phase. A total of 6331 proteins were identified and quantified, of which 127 were differentially expressed between the LAF-treated and untreated groups. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed that DEPs mainly participated in the cell cycle. CDKN1C/p57 showed the most significant differential expression, with the highest fold-change (3.155-fold).

DNA methylation analyses showed that microbiota and IL10KO were associated with changes in 5% and 4.1% of CpG sites, while mice with both factors had 18% alterations. Microbiota, IL10KO, and their combination altered 0.4%, 0.4%, and 4% of CpG island methylation, respectively. These are comparable to what is seen in colon cancer. Ageing changes were accelerated in the IL10KO mice with microbiota, and the affected genes were more likely to be altered in colon cancer. Thus, the microbiota affect DNA methylation of the colon in patterns reminiscent of what is observed in ageing and colorectal cancer.',\n","       'Traction by dental floss loop for adequate submucosal dissection depth in a rectal neuroendocrine tumor.nan',\n","       'Virtual scale endoscope-assisted wide-field resection of large sessile serrated lesions.nan',\n","       'High endothelial venules proportion in tertiary lymphoid structure is a prognostic marker and correlated with anti-tumor immune microenvironment in colorectal cancer.BACKGROUND: High endothelial venules (HEV) and tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) are associated with clinical outcomes of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). However, because HEV are components of TLS, there have been few studies of the role of the HEV proportion in TLS (HEV/TLS). This study investigated the role of the HEV/TLS and its relationship with the tumor immune microenvironment in CRC. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 203 cases of tissue pathologically diagnosed as CRC after general surgery was performed at the First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University from January 2014 to July 2017. Paraffin sections were obtained from the paracancerous intestinal mucosal tissues. The area of HEV and TLS and immune cells were detected by immunohistochemistry. We further divided the positive HEV expression group into the high HEV/TLS group and the low HEV/TLS group by the average area of HEV/TLS. After grouping, the data were also analyzed using the chi-square test, Kaplan-Meier method, and univariate and multivariate Cox proportional risk regression analyses. A correlation analysis of the HEV/TLS and immune cells as well as angiogenesis was performed. RESULTS: Patients with a high HEV/TLS in CRC tissue were associated with longer OS, DFS and lower TNM stage. Meanwhile, CRC tissue with a high HEV/TLS showed a greater ability to recruit the CD3+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and M1 macrophages and correlated with less angiogenesis. Conclusively, high HEV/TLS links to the favorable prognosis of CRC patients and correlated with anti-tumor immune microenvironment, which can be a potential biomarker for prognosis of CRC patients. CONCLUSION: A high HEV/TLS is associated with a favorable prognosis for CRC and is correlated with the anti-tumor immune microenvironment. Therefore, it is a potential biomarker of the CRC prognosis.KEY MESSAGESHigh HEV/TLS is associated with a favorable prognosis for CRC.High HEV/TLS correlated with the anti-tumor immune microenvironment of CRC and can serve as a novel prognostic biomarker.',\n","       'A case of rectal diverticulitis resembling a submucosal tumor under colorectal endoscopy: a hitherto undescribed lesion.nan',\n","       'Endoscopic submucosal dissection of colonic residual laterally spreading tumor with adaptive traction: use of the additional loops to improve traction focally in difficult area.nan',\n","       'Endoscopic intermuscular dissection for a lower rectal gastrointestinal stromal tumor.nan',\n","       'Combining endoscopic mucosal resection with hybrid argon plasma coagulation to reduce local colorectal lesion recurrence: a video tutorial.nan',\n","       'Underwater endoscopic submucosal dissection of a relapsing neoplastic colorectal lesion after surgery and radiotherapy: water to the rescue!nan',\n","       'Sprouty4 is epigenetically upregulated in human colorectal cancer.Sprouty4 (SPRY4) has been frequently reported as a tumor suppressor and is therefore downregulated in various cancers. For the first time, we report that SPRY4 is epigenetically upregulated in colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, we explored DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation levels of SPRY4 in CRC cells and patient samples and correlated these findings with mRNA and protein expression levels. Three loci within the promoter region of SPRY4 were evaluated for 5mC levels in CRC using the combined bisulfite restriction analysis. In addition, hydroxymethylation levels within SPRY4 were measured in CRC patients. Lastly, DNA methylation and mRNA expression data were extracted from CRC patients in multiple high-throughput data repositories like Gene Expression Omnibus and The Cancer Genome Atlas. Combined in vitro and in silico analysis of promoter methylation levels of SPRY4 clearly demonstrates that the distal promoter region undergoes hypomethylation in CRC patients and is associated with increased expression. Moreover, a decrease in gene body hydroxymethylation and an increase in gene body methylation within the coding region of SPRY4 were found in CRC patients and correlated with increased expression. SPRY4 is epigenetically upregulated in CRC by promoter hypomethylation and hypermethylation within the gene body that warrants future investigation of atypical roles of this established tumor suppressor.',\n","       'Endoscopic full-thickness resection with reconstruction of the rectal wall.nan',\n","       'Colonic intussusception due to filiform polyposis of ulcerative colitis treated by endoscopic reduction.nan',\n","       'Telomerase RNA component lncRNA as potential diagnostic biomarker promotes CRC cellular migration and apoptosis evasion via modulation of β-catenin protein level.AIM: Long non-coding RNA (LncRNA) telomerase RNA component (TERC) has telomerase-dependent and independent activity in numerous cancer types. The present study purposes to demonstrate the role of lncRNA TERC as a diagnostic serum biomarker in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and the molecular mechanism of lncRNA TERC in inducing tumor in CRC cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PCR array was performed to examine lncRNAs dysregulated in CRC. LncRNA TERC expression level was evaluated in 70 CRC patients and 35 control subjects using RT-qPCR. Then transfection was performed to build down-expression models of lncRNA TERC. ROC curve analysis was applied to assess the diagnostic value of serum LncRNA CRC. In addition, RT-qPCR was used to detect expression level of lncRNA TERC and β-catenin mRNA. Moreover, ELISA and Western blot were used to detect the level of β-catenin protein in sera of CRC patients and cell lines. The biological functions such as cell growth and migration of CRC cells were assessed using a wound healing assay. Cell cycle analysis and apoptosis analysis were performed using flow cytometry. RESULTS: The lncRNA TERC is overexpressed in the sera of CRC patients with high diagnostic and stage discrimination accuracy. Furthermore, lncRNA TERC expression was upregulated in CRC cell lines and lncRNA TERC silencing induced cell arrest and apoptosis and inhibited cell migration. Furthermore, inhibition of lncRNA TERC reduces β-catenin protein levels. CONCLUSION: The lncRNA TERC could be considered as an early stages CRC diagnostic biomarker with a good ability to discriminate between CRC stages. lncRNA TERC induces CRC by promoting cell migration and evading apoptosis by elevating the level of β-catenin protein.',\n","       'Ionizable polymeric nanocarriers for the codelivery of bi-adjuvant and neoantigens in combination tumor immunotherapy.Ionizable lipid nanocarriers have made historical contribution to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Here, we report ionizable polymeric nanoparticles that co-deliver bi-adjuvant and neoantigen peptides for cancer immunotherapy in combination with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Current cancer ICB benefits only a small subset of patients, largely due to a lack of pre-existing target cells and checkpoint targets for ICB, tumor antigenic heterogeneity, and tumor immunosuppression. Therapeutic vaccines hold the potential to enhance ICB therapeutic efficacy by expanding antitumor cell repertoires, upregulating immune checkpoint levels and hence sensitizing ICB, and reducing tumor immunosuppression. Chemically defined peptide vaccines are attractive, but their current therapeutic efficacy has been limited due to 1) poor vaccine delivery to immunomodulatory lymph nodes (LNs) and antigen (Ag)-presenting cells (APCs), 2) poor immunostimulant adjuvant efficacy with restricted target cell subsets in humans, 3) limited adjuvant/Ag codelivery to enhance Ag immunogenicity, and 4) limited ability to overcome tumor antigenic heterogeneity. Here, we developed nanovaccines (NVs) using pH-responsive polymeric micellular nanoparticles (NPs) for the codelivery of bi-adjuvant [Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/8 agonist R848 and TLR9 agonist CpG] and peptide neoantigens (neoAgs) to draining LNs for efficient Ag presentation in a broad range of APC subsets. These NVs potentiated the immunogenicity of peptide Ags and elicits robust antitumor T cell responses with memory, and remodeled the tumor immune milium with reduced tumor immunosuppression. As a result, NVs significantly enhanced ICB therapeutic efficacy for murine colorectal tumors and orthotopic glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). These results suggest marked potential of bi-adjuvant/neoAg-codelivering NVs for combination cancer immunotherapy.',\n","       'Characteristics of adenomatous colorectal polyps among a Saudi population.OBJECTIVES: Colorectal cancer is a common cause of cancer-related mortality in KSA with a rising incidence. Although adenomatous polyps are well-recognized as precursors of colorectal cancer, local data are scarce. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the characteristics of adenomatous colon polyps in the Saudi population. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the electronic databases of all patients who underwent colonoscopy for any indication between January 2015 and December 2019 at a tertiary care hospital. This study included adult patients who were found to have colorectal polyps with identified histopathology reports. We collected clinical and pathological data, including patient age, sex, and histopathological polyp characteristics. A p-value <0.05 was considered significant for descriptive and analytical statistics. RESULTS: A total of 184 patients with colorectal polyps with identified histopathology reports were included in the analysis. Of these, 130 (70.6%) patients were aged 50 years or older, and 135 (73.3%) were male. Among all polyps, 127 (69%) were adenomatous, 31 (16.8%) were hyperplastic, and 24 (13%) were inflammatory. For adenomatous polyps, 31 (24.4%) were observed in patients younger than 50 years, and high-grade dysplasia was observed in 23 (18%) polyps. Among patients with adenomatous polyps, the anatomical location was as follows: 27 (23%) in the cecum/ascending colon, 12 (9%) in the transverse colon, 45 (35%) in the descending/sigmoid colon, 25 (19%) in the rectum, and 18 (14%) at multiple sites. Age >50 years was significantly associated with adenomatous polyps (P\\xa0=\\xa00.03). CONCLUSION: Approximately one-third of adenomatous polyps were detected proximal to the splenic flexure. Although adenomatous polyps were significantly associated with increasing age, 24% were observed in patients younger than 50 years of age. This finding supports the current recommendation to start screening at the age of 45.',\n","       'Three-dimensional ordered DNA network constructed by a biomarker pair for accurate monitoring of colorectal cancer.Precise and early screening of colorectal cancer (CRC) is one crucial yet challenging task for its treatment, and the analysis of multi-targets of CRC in a single assay with high accuracy is essential for pathological research and clinical diagnosis. Here, a CRC-related biomarker pair, microRNA-211 (miRNA-211) and H(2)S, was detected by constructing a three-dimensional (3D) ordered DNA network. First, trace amount of miRNA-211 could initiate a hybridization chain reaction-based amplification process. A highly ordered 3D DNA network was formed based on the organized assembly of DNA-cube frameworks that were constructed by DNA origamis and Ag nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated inside. In the presence of the H(2)S, Ag NPs within the network can be etched to generate Ag(2)S quantum dots, which could be better visualized in fluorescence in situ cell imaging. Using the 3D DNA ordered network as the sensing platform, it can acquire dual analysis of biomolecule (miRNA-211) and inorganic gas (H(2)S) in vitro, overcoming the limitations of single type of biomarker detection in a single assay. This assay achieved a wide linearity range of H(2)S from 0.05 to 10\\xa0μM, and exhibited a low limit of detection of 4.78\\xa0nM. This strategy allows us to acquire the spatial distributions of H(2)S and miRNA expression levels in living CRC cells simultaneously, providing a highly sensitive and selective tool for early screening and monitoring of CRC.',\n","       'Protective effect of total flavonoids of Engelhardia roxburghiana Wall. leaves against radiation-induced intestinal injury in mice and its mechanism.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Irradiation-induced intestinal injury (RIII) often occurs during radiotherapy in patients, which would result in abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and even death. Engelhardia roxburghiana Wall. leaves, a traditional Chinese herb, has unique anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, antioxidant, and analgesic effects, is used to treat damp-heat diarrhea, hernia, and abdominal pain, and has the potential to protect against RIII. AIM OF THE STUDY: To explore the protective effects of the total flavonoids of Engelhardia roxburghiana Wall. leaves (TFERL) on RIII and provide some reference for the application of Engelhardia roxburghiana Wall. leaves in the field of radiation protection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect of TFERL on the survival rate of mice was observed after a lethal radiation dose (7.2\\xa0Gy) by ionizing radiation (IR). To better observe the protective effects of the TFERL on RIII, a mice model of RIII induced by IR (13\\xa0Gy) was established. Small intestinal crypts, villi, intestinal stem cells (ISC) and the proliferation of ISC were observed by haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression of genes related to intestinal integrity. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione (GSH), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in the serum of mice were assessed. In vitro, cell models of RIII induced by IR (2, 4, 6, 8\\xa0Gy) were established. Normal human intestinal epithelial cells HIEC-6\\xa0cells were treated with TFERL/Vehicle, and the radiation protective effect of TFERL on HIEC-6\\xa0cells was detected by clone formation assay. DNA damage was detected by comet assay and immunofluorescence assay. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), cell cycle and apoptosis rate were detected by flow cytometry. Oxidative stress, apoptosis and ferroptosis-related proteins were detected by western blot. Finally, the colony formation assay was used to detect the effect of TFERL on the radiosensitivity of colorectal cancer cells. RESULTS: TFERL treatment can increase the survival rate and time of the mice after a lethal radiation dose. In the mice model of RIII induced by IR, TFERL alleviated RIII by reducing intestinal crypt/villi structural damage, increasing the number and proliferation of ISC, and maintaining the integrity of the intestinal epithelium after total abdominal irradiation. Moreover, TFERL promoted the proliferation of irradiated HIEC-6\\xa0cells, and reduced radiation-induced apoptosis and DNA damage. Mechanism studies have found that TFERL promotes the expression of NRF2 and its downstream antioxidant proteins, and silencing NRF2 resulted in the loss of radioprotection by TFERL, suggesting that TFERL exerts radiation protection by activating the NRF2 pathway. Surprisingly, TFERL reduced the number of clones of colon cancer cells after irradiation, suggesting that TFERL can increase the radiosensitivity of colon cancer cells. CONCLUSION: Our data showed that TFERL inhibited oxidative stress, reduced DNA damage, reduced apoptosis and ferroptosis, and improved IR-induced RIII. This study may offer a fresh approach to using Chinese herbs for radioprotection.',\n","       'Identification of potential bioactive compounds of Passiflora edulis leaf extract against colon adenocarcinoma cells.Plant bioactive compounds such as flavonoids and triterpenes can affect lipid metabolism.

Magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate (MgIG) has hepatoprotective effects, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. The study's aim was to investigate the mechanism underlying the hepatoprotective effects of MgIG against oxaliplatin-induced liver injury. METHODS: A xenografted colorectal cancer mouse model was established with MC38 cells. Mice were given oxaliplatin (6 mg/kg/week) for 5 weeks to mimic oxaliplatin-induced liver injury in vivo. LX-2 human hepatic stellate cell s(HSCs) were employed for in vitro studies. Serological tests, hematoxylin and eosin staining, oil red O staining and transmission electron microscopy were used for histopathological examinations. Real-time PCR, western blotting, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical staining were used to determine Cx43 mRNA or protein levels. Flow cytometry was used to assay reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane. Short hairpin RNA targeting Cx43 was lentivirally transduced in LX-2 cells. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to determine MgIG and metabolite concentration. RESULTS: MgIG (40 mg/kg/day) treatment significantly reduced serum aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels in the mouse model, and alleviated liver pathological changes, including necrosis, sinusoidal expansion, mitochondrial damage, and fibrosis. MgIG reduced the abnormal expression of Cx43 in the mitochondria and nuclei of HSCs. MgIG inhibited the activation of HSCs via reducing ROS generation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and N-cadherin transcription. MgIG's inhibition of HSCs activation was abolished after knockdown of Cx43 in LX-2 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Cx43 mediated MgIG's hepatoprotective effects against oxaliplatin-induced toxicity.\",\n","       'Toxic profile of marinobufagin from poisonous Amazon toads and antitumoral effects on human colorectal carcinomas.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: South Americans natives have extensively used the toad \"kururu\" to reduce/treat skin infections, cutaneous lesions and sores. They release secretions rich in bufadienolides, polyhydroxy steroids with well-documented cardiotonic and antiproliferative actions, but in vivo antitumoral evaluations in mammals are rare, and toxicological safety has been left in second place. AIMS OF THE STUDY: This investigation used in silico, in vitro and in vivo tools to evaluate acute and subacute toxic effects of marinobufagin and the anticancer action in tumor-bearing mice models. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Initially, in silico toxic predictions were performed, followed by in vitro assays using human and murine normal and tumor lines. Next, acute and subacute studies on mice investigated the behavior, hematological and intestinal transit profile and antitumoral activity of marinobufagin in sarcoma 180- and HCT-116 colorectal carcinoma-transplanted mice for 7 and 15 days, respectively. Ex vivo and in vivo cytogenetic assays in Sarcoma 180 and bone marrow cells and histopathological examinations were also executed. RESULTS: In silico studies revealed ecotoxicological effects on crustaceans (Daphnia sp.), fishes (Pimephales promelas and Oryzias latipes), and algae. A 24-h marinobufagin-induced acute toxicity included signals of central activity, mainly (vocal frenzy, absence of body tonus, increased ventilation, ataxia, and equilibrium loss), and convulsions and death at 10\\xa0mg/kg. The bufadienolide presented effective in vitro cytotoxic action on human lines of colorectal carcinomas in a similar way to ouabain and tumor reduction in marinobufagin-treated SCID-bearing HCT-116 heterotopic xenografts. Animals under subacute nonlethal doses exhibited a decrease in creatinine clearance with normal levels of blood urea, probably as a result of a marinobufagin-induced renal perfusion fall. Nevertheless, only minor morphological side effects were identified in kidneys, livers, hearts and lungs. CONCLUSIONS: Marinobufagin has in vitro and in vivo anticancer action on colorectal carcinoma and mild and reversible alterations in key metabolic organs without direct chemotherapy-induced gastrointestinal effects at subacute exposure, but it causes acute ataxia, equilibrium loss, convulsions and death at higher acute exposure.',\n","       'Long-term DEHP/MEHP exposure promotes colorectal cancer stemness associated with glycosylation alterations.Plasticizers are considered as environmental pollution released from medical devices and increased potential oncogenic risks in clinical therapy. Our previous studies have shown that long-term exposure to di-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP)/mono-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP) promotes chemotherapeutic drug resistance in colorectal cancer. In this study, we investigated the alteration of glycosylation in colorectal cancer following long-term plasticizers exposure. First, we determined the profiles of cell surface N-glycomes by using mass spectrometry and found out the alterations of α2,8-linkages glycans. Next, we analyzed the correlation between serum DEHP/MEHP levels and ST8SIA6 expression from matched tissues in total 110 colorectal cancer patients. Moreover, clinical specimens and TCGA database were used to analyze the expression of ST8SIA6 in advanced stage of cancer. Finally, we showed that ST8SIA6 regulated stemness in vitro and in vivo. Our results revealed long-term DEHP/MEHP exposure significantly caused cancer patients with poorer survival outcome and attenuated the expression of ST8SIA6 in cancer cells and tissue samples. As expected, silencing of ST8SIA6 promoted cancer stemness and tumorigenicity by upregulating stemness-associated proteins. In addition, the cell viability assay showed enhanced drug resistance in ST8SIA6 silencing cells treated with irinotecan. Besides, ST8SIA6 was downregulated in the advanced stage and positively correlated with tumor recurrence in colorectal cancer.

Patients with the genetic disorder Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) develop hundreds to thousands of polyps that unless removed by prophylactic colectomy will progress to CRC at an early age. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and the ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), have been evaluated for their chemopreventive potential in delaying CRC onset in high-risk patients. In our study, we determined whether the NSAID, naproxen, alone or in combination with a chemically-stable EPA analog (TP-252), affects tumor formation in the Apc(Pirc) rat model. When compared to control diet, animals fed naproxen or HD TP-252 had 66% and 82% fewer tumors, respectively. However, animals fed a combination of naproxen and HD TP-252, exhibited a 95% reduction in tumor formation and a 98% reduction in tumor volume, respectively. To elucidate potential mechanisms of tumor protection, a comprehensive, targeted lipidomic analysis was performed on colonic mucosa to determine changes in eicosanoid metabolism. Animals receiving TP-252 alone or in combination with naproxen had significantly reduced mucosal levels of proinflammatory ω-6 eicosanoids (PGE(2) , 5-HETE and 14,15-DiHETrE), along with a simultaneous increase in anti-inflammatory EPA-derived ω-3 eicosanoids. A comprehensive lipidomic analysis also uncovered several potential pharmacodynamic (PD) lipid biomarkers, including resolvin E2, 9-HEPE, 12-HEPE and 18-HEPE, that were significantly correlated with tumor protection. Further studies with this drug combination should be focused on dose optimization and the role of EPA-derived lipid mediators in CRC initiation and progression.',\n","       'Advances in \"adiponcosis\": Insights in the inner mechanisms at the base of adipose and tumour tissues interplay.The epidemic spread of obesity is nowadays recognized as a global health and economic burden, arising great interest in the scientific community. The rate of adult obesity steadily increases concomitantly with the cancer incidence. As has been comprehensively reported, obesity is included among the multiple cancer risk factors and can progressively cause and/or exacerbate certain cancer types, as colorectal and breast cancers. The term adiponcosis was forged precisely to emphasize the interconnection between obesity and cancer onset and progression. The underlying mechanisms of adiponcosis have not been fully elucidated yet, may vary on cancer type, and depend on body fat distribution. It has been proposed that insulin resistance and related chronic hyperinsulinemia, increased insulin-like growth factors production, chronic inflammation or increased bioavailability of steroid hormones could be responsible of cancer hallmarks. Additionally, it has been suggested that adipose tissue-derived hormones, cytokines and adipokines, such as leptin, adiponectin and inflammatory markers, may reflect mechanisms linked to tumorigenesis. This review summarizes the current evidence on pathways, hormones, cytokines and low-chronic inflammation subtending adiponconsis, focusing on breast and colorectal cancers. In addition, we analyzed the lifestyle interventions that could attenuate the driving forces of obesity-related cancer incidence and progression. Moreover, current targets and drugs, their pros and cons, as well as new mechanisms and targets with promising therapeutic potential in cancer are discussed. Depicting this complex interconnection will provide insights for establishing new therapeutic approaches to halt the obesity impacts and thwart cancer onset and progression.',\n","       'Patrinia villosa treat colorectal cancer by activating PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: At present, the colorectal cancer (CRC) is a malignant tumor of the colon and rectum that is often found at the junction of the two, and it will invade many visceral organs and organizations, causing very serious damage to the body of the patient. Patrinia villosa Juss. (P.V), is a well-known traditional chinese medicine (TCM), and is recorded in the Compendium of Materia Medica as a necessary article for the treatment of intestinal carbuncle. It has been incorporated into traditional cancer treatment prescriptions in modern medicine. While the mechanism of action of P.V in the treatment of CRC remains unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate P.V in treating CRC and clarify the underlying mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was based on Azoxymethane (AOM) combined with the Dextran Sulfate Sodium Salt (DSS)-induced CRC mouse model to clarify the pharmacological effects of P.V. The mechanism of action was found by metabolites and metabolomics. The rationality of metabolomics results was verified through the clinical target database of network pharmacology, and find the upstream and downstream target information of relevant action pathways. Apart from that, the targets of associated pathways were confirmed, and the mechanism of action was made clear, using quantitative PCR (q-PCR) and Western blot. RESULTS: The number and the diameter of tumors were decreased when mice were treated with P.V. P.V group section results showed newly generated cells which improved the degree of colon cell injury. Pathological indicators presented a trend of recovery to normal cells. Compared to the model group, P.V groups had significantly lower levels of the CRC biomarkers CEA, CA19-9, and CA72-4. Through the evaluation of metabolites and metabolomics, it was found that a total of 50 endogenous metabolites had significant changes. Most of these are modulated and recovered after P.V treatment. It alters glycerol phospholipid metabolites, which are closely related to PI3K target, suggesting that P.V can treat CRC though the PI3K target and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. q-PCR and Western blot results also verified that the expression of VEGF, PI3K, Akt, P38, JNK, ERK1/2, TP53, IL-6, TNF-α and Caspase-3 were significantly decreased, whereas that of Caspase-9 was increased after treatment. CONCLUSION: P.V is dependent on PI3K target and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway for CRC treatment.',\n","       'Oncogenic signaling is coupled to colorectal cancer cell differentiation state.Colorectal cancer progression is intrinsically linked to stepwise deregulation of the intestinal differentiation trajectory. In this process, sequential mutations of APC, KRAS, TP53, and SMAD4 enable oncogenic signaling and establish the hallmarks of cancer. Here, we use mass cytometry of isogenic human colon organoids and patient-derived cancer organoids to capture oncogenic signaling, cell phenotypes, and differentiation states in a high-dimensional single-cell map. We define a differentiation axis in all tumor progression states from normal to cancer. Our data show that colorectal cancer driver mutations shape the distribution of cells along the differentiation axis. In this regard, subsequent mutations can have stem cell promoting or restricting effects. Individual nodes of the cancer cell signaling network remain coupled to the differentiation state, regardless of the presence of driver mutations. We use single-cell RNA sequencing to link the (phospho-)protein signaling network to transcriptomic states with biological and clinical relevance. Our work highlights how oncogenes gradually shape signaling and transcriptomes during tumor progression.',\n","       'Therapeutic effects of natural polyphenols on colorectal adenomas: Focus on preclinical studies (Review).Colorectal adenoma (CRA) is a premalignant lesion of colorectal cancer. The current treatment is surgical resection, but CRA is prone to recurrence, and there is no safe and effective drug to prevent adenoma recurrence and canceration. Recent studies have shown that natural compounds in plants have favorable antitumor effects. According to preclinical studies, natural polyphenols can regulate different signal pathways and targets to play a role in the treatment of CRA, which is closely related to its inhibition of proliferation, induction of apoptosis, inhibition of inflammation and oxidative stress, and regulation of intestinal flora. Natural polyphenols are potential candidates for CRA therapy due to their remarkable efficacy and safety. In the present review, attention was paid to the experimental research progress of natural polyphenols extracted from numerous plants in the treatment of CRA in the last 10\\xa0years. The present review provided new guidance for the study of CRA, clarified the therapeutic role of polyphenols in CRA, and evaluated for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, the therapeutic potential of natural polyphenols to treat CRA by targeting multiple genes and signal pathways and epigenetic modification.',\n","       'mHealth Coping Skills Training for Symptom Management (mCOPE) for colorectal cancer patients in early to mid-adulthood: Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) patients in early to mid-adulthood (≤50 years) are challenged by high symptom burden (i.e., pain, fatigue, distress) and age-related stressors (e.g., managing family, work). Cognitive behavioral theory (CBT)-based coping skills training interventions reduce symptoms and improve quality of life in cancer patients. However, traditional CBT-based interventions are not accessible to these patients (e.g., in-person sessions, during work day), nor designed to address symptoms within the context of this stage of life. We developed a mobile health (mHealth) coping skills training program for pain, fatigue and distress (mCOPE) for CRC patients in early to mid-adulthood. We utilize a randomized controlled trial to test the extent to which mCOPE reduces pain, fatigue and distress (multiple primary outcomes) and improves quality of life and symptom self-efficacy (secondary outcomes). METHODS/DESIGN: Patients (N\\xa0=\\xa0160) ≤50 years with CRC endorsing pain, fatigue and/or distress are randomized 1:1 to mCOPE or standard care. mCOPE is a five-session CBT-based coping skills training program (e.g., relaxation, activity pacing, cognitive restructuring) that was adapted for CRC patients in early to mid-adulthood. mCOPE utilizes mHealth technology (e.g., videoconference, mobile app) to deliver coping skills training, capture symptom and skills use data, and provide personalized support and feedback. Self-report assessments are completed at baseline, post-treatment (5-8 weeks post-baseline; primary endpoint), and 3- and 6-months later. CONCLUSIONS: mCOPE is innovative and potentially impactful for CRC patients in early to mid-adulthood. Hypothesis confirmation would demonstrate initial efficacy of a mHealth cognitive behavioral intervention to reduce symptom burden in younger CRC patients.',\n","       'From adenoma to CRC stages: the oral-gut microbiome axis as a source of potential microbial and metabolic biomarkers of malignancy.BACKGROUND: Approximately 95% of Colorectal cancers (CRC) consist of adenocarcinomas originating from colonic Adenomatous polyps (AP). Increasing importance in CRC occurrence and progression has been attributed to the gut microbiota; however, a huge proportion of microorganisms inhabit the human digestive system. So, to comprehensively study the microbial spatial variations and their role in CRC progression, from AP to the different CRC phases, a holistic vision is imperative, including the simultaneous evaluation of multiple niches from the gastrointestinal system. Through an integrated approach, we identified potential microbial and metabolic biomarkers, able to discriminate human CRC from AP and/or also the different Tumor node metastasis (TNM) staging. In addition, as the microbiota contributes to the production of essential metabolic products detectable in fecal samples, we analysed and compared metabolites obtained from CRC and AP patients by using a Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) approach. METHODS: In this observational study, saliva, tissue and stool samples from 61 patients, have been collected, including 46 CRC and 15 AP patients, age and sex-matched, undergoing surgery in 2018 at the Careggi University Hospital (Florence, Italy). First, the microbiota in the three-district between CRC and AP patients has been characterized, as well as in different CRC TNM stages. Subsequently, proton NMR spectroscopy has been used in combination with multivariate and univariate statistical approaches, to define the fecal metabolic profile of a restricted group of CRC and AP patients. RESULTS: CRC patients display a different profile of tissue and fecal microbiota with respect to AP patients. Significant differences have been observed in CRC tissue microbial clades, with a rise of the Fusobacterium genus. In addition, significant taxa increase at the genus level has been observed in stool samples of CRC patients. Furthermore, Fusobacterium found in intestinal tissue has been positively correlated with fecal Parvimonas, for the first time. Moreover, as predicted by metagenomics pathway analysis, a significant increase of lactate (p=0.037) has been observed in the CRC fecal metabolic profiles, and positively correlated with Bifidobacterium (p=0.036). Finally, minor bacterial differences in CRC patients at stage T2 (TNM classification) have been detected, with a raise of the Spirochaetota phylum in CRC samples, with a slight increase of the Alphaproteobacteria class in fecal samples. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest the importance of microbiota communities and oncometabolites in CRC development. Further studies on CRC/AP management with a focus on CRC assessment are needed to investigate novel microbial-related diagnostic tools aimed to improve therapeutic interventions.',\n","       'Role of the voltage‑gated sodium channel Nav1.6 in glioma and candidate drugs screening.Gliomas remain a clinical challenge, common and fatal. Treatment of glioblastoma remains elusive, and researchers have focused on discovering new mechanisms and drugs. It has been well established that the expression of voltage‑gated sodium channels (VGSCs) is abnormally increased in numerous malignancies and, in general, is rarely expressed in the corresponding normal tissues. This suggests that ion channel activity appears to be associated with malignant progression of tumors. VGSCs remain largely unknown as to how their activity leads to an increase in cancer cell activity or invasiveness. Certain sodium ion channel subtypes (for instance, Nav1.5 and Nav1.7) are associated with metastasis and invasion in cancers including breast and colorectal cancers. A previous study by the authors explored the expression of certain ion channels in glioma, but there are few studies related to Nav1.6. The current study aimed to elucidate the expression and role of Nav1.6 in glioma and to screen potential drugs for the treatment of glioma by virtual screening and drug sensitivity analysis. Nav1.6 relative expression of mRNA and protein was determined by reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR and western blot analysis. Cell proliferation was determined by Cell Counting Kit‑8 assay. Cell migration was assessed by cellular wound healing assay. Cell invasion and apoptosis were detected by Transwell cell invasion assay and flow cytometry. Last but not least, FDA‑approved drugs were screened using virtual screening, molecular docking and NCI‑60 drug sensitivity analyses based on the expression and structure of Nav1.6. In glioma cells, Nav1.6 was significantly upregulated and expressed mostly in the cytoplasm and cell membrane; its expression was positively correlated with pathological grade. A172 and U251 cells exhibited reduced proliferation, migration and invasion when Nav1.6 expression was knocked down, and apoptosis was increased. TNF‑α (100\\xa0pg/ml) acting on glioma cells was found to upregulate the expression level of Nav1.6, and TNF‑α was involved in the process of Nav1.6 promoting malignant progression of glioma. Finally, certain FDA‑approved drugs were identified by virtual screening and drug sensitivity analysis. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated the expression and role of Nav1.6 in glioma and identified several FDA‑approved drugs that are highly correlated with Nav1.6 and could be candidate drugs for patients with glioma.',\n","       'A review of nemorosone: Chemistry and biological properties.Nemorosone is a bicyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinol derivative originally isolated from Clusia spp. and it can be obtained through chemical synthesis employing different synthetic strategies. Since its discovery, it has attracted great attention both from a biological and chemical viewpoint. In the present article, we attempted to review various chemical and biological topics around nemorosone, with an emphasis on its antiproliferative activities. For this purpose, relevant data was collected from different scientific databases including Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus and ISI Web of Knowledge. This natural compound has shown activity against several types of malignancies such as leukemia, human colorectal, pancreatic, and breast cancer because it modulates multiple molecular pathways. Nemorosone has both cytostatic and cytotoxic activity and it also seems to induce apoptosis and ferroptosis. Additionally, it has antimicrobial capabilities against Gram-positive bacteria and parasites belonging to genus Leishmania. Its promising antiproliferative pre-clinical effects deserve further attention for anticancer and anti-parasitic drug development and translation to the clinic.',\n","       'Structure optimization of an F-indole-chalcone (FC116) on 4-methoxyphenyl group and therapeutic potential against colorectal cancers with low cytotoxicity.Advanced metastatic colorectal cancers (CRCs) are regarded as a challenge in clinical cancer therapy. Our previous studies have demonstrated that a representative fluoro-substituted indole-chalcone (FC116), was obtained to display highly potent activity against CRC using multiple in vitro and in vivo mouse models by targeting microtubules. However, several problems, such as low dose tolerance and highly toxic to the brain and colon, low solubility unsuitable for intravenous (i.v.) administration, are still existed and limit further development. Herein, we developed two series of FC116 derivatives on the 4-methoxyphenyl group by a structure-based design strategy. Among them, FC11619 with an amino terminus maintained the in vitro cytotoxicity against HCT-116 CRC in a low nanomolar range. This compound could induce G2/M phase arrest via regulating cyclin B1 expression, produce excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), and target tubulin in CRC cells. In vivo, FC11619 significantly suppressed tumor growth, achieving 65.3 and 73.4 % at doses of 5 and 10\\xa0mg/kg/d (i.v., 21 d), which were much better than 54.1% of Taxol at 7\\xa0mg/kg. In addition, this compound showed better in vivo tolerance compared to that of FC116 (only 3\\xa0mg/kg tolerance, intraperitoneal, i.p.), and no major organ-related toxicity, especially no apparent degenerated neurons, intestinal obstruction in clinical Taxol standard therapy. Taken together, the 4-amino-substitutedphenyl indole-chalcones represent lead compounds as chemotherapy of CRC for further drug development in this field.',\n","       \"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the early-onset colorectal cancer.The COVID19 pandemic has affected the spectrum of cancer care worldwide. Early onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC) is defined as diagnosis below the age of 50. Patients with EOCRC faced multiple challenges during the COVID19 pandemic and in some institutions it jeopardized cancer diagnosis and care delivery. Our study aims to identify the clinicopathological features and outcomes of patients with EOCRC in our Centre during the first wave of the pandemic in comparison with the same period in 2019 and 2021. Patients with EOCRC visited for the first time at Vall d'Hebron University Hospital in Spain from the 1st March to 31st August of 2019, 2020 and 2021 were included in the analysis. 177 patients with EOCRC were visited for the first time between 2019 and 2021, of which 90 patients met the inclusion criteria (2019: 30 patients, 2020: 29 patients, 2021: 31 patients). Neither differences in frequency nor in stage at diagnosis or at first visit during the given periods were observed. Of note, indication of systemic therapy in the adjuvant or metastatic setting was not altered. Days to treatment initiation and enrollment in clinical trials in this subpopulation was not affected due to the COVID-19 outbreak.\",\n","       \"Berberine is a suppressor of Hedgehog signaling cascade in colorectal cancer.BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a malignant affliction that burdens people globally. Overactivated Hedgehog signal is highly implicated in CRC pathogenesis. Phytochemical berberine exerts strong potency on CRC, with molecular mechanism elusive. PURPOSE: We sought to study berberine's anti-CRC action and explore its underlying mechanism based on Hedgehog signaling cascade. METHODS: In CRC HCT116 cells and SW480 cells treated with berberine, the proliferation, migration, invasion, clonogenesis, apoptosis and cell cycle were measured, with determination of Hedgehog signaling pathway activity. Following establishment of mouse model of HCT116 xenograft tumor, the efficacies of berberine on carcinogenesis, pathological manifestation and malignant phenotypes of CRC were examined, with analysis of Hedgehog signaling axis in HCT116 xenograft tumor tissues. Additionally, toxicological study of berberine was conducted on zebrafish. RESULTS: Berberine was discovered to suppress the proliferation, migration, invasion and clonogenesis of HCT116 cells and SW480 cells. Furthermore, berberine caused cell apoptosis and blockaded cell cycle at phase G(0)/G(1) in CRC cells, with dampened Hedgehog signaling cascade. In HCT116 xenograft tumor of nude mice, berberine inhibited tumor growth, alleviated pathological score, and promoted apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in tumor tissues, through constraining Hedgehog signaling. The toxicological study of berberine on zebrafish indicated that berberine incurred damage to the liver and heart of zebrafish at high dosage and prolonged administration. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, berberine may inhibit the malignant phenotypes of CRC through diminishing Hedgehog signaling cascade. However, the potential adverse reactions should be taken into account upon abuse of berberine.\",\n","       \"Exploring the anti-metastatic effects of Astragalus mongholicus Bunge-Curcuma aromatica Salisb. on colorectal cancer: A network-based metabolomics and pharmacology approach.BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignancy that can significantly diminish patients' quality of life. Astragalus mongholicus Bunge-Curcuma aromatica Salisb. (AC) is an ancient Chinese medicinal combination used for the treatment of CRC. However, the core ingredients and targets involved in regulating lipid and amino acid metabolism in CRC remain unknown. We aimed to explore the key components and pharmacological mechanisms of AC in the treatment of CRC through a comprehensive analysis of network metabolomics, network pharmacology, molecular docking, and biological methods. METHODS: Ultra-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (MS) was used for quality control. Gas chromatography/MS and liquid chromatography/MS were used to detect metabolites in the feces and serum of CRC mice. A network pharmacology approach and molecular docking were used to explore the potential genes involved in the CRC-target-component network. The effect of AC on tumor immunity was investigated using flow cytometry and polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: AC, high-dose AC, and 5-fluorouracil treatment reduced liver metastasis and tumor mass. Compared with the CRC group, 2 amino acid metabolites and 14 lipid metabolites (LPC, PC, PE) were upregulated and 15 amino acid metabolites and 9 lipid metabolites (TG, PE, PG, 12-HETE) were downregulated. Subsequently, through network analysis, four components and six hub genes were identified for molecular docking. AC can bind to ALDH1B1, ALDH2, CAT, GOT2, NOS3, and ASS1 through beta-Elemene, canavanine, betaine, and chrysanthemaxanthin. AC promoted the responses of M1 macrophages and down-regulated the responses of M2 macrophages, Treg cells, and the gene expression of related factors. CONCLUSION: Our research showed that AC effectively inhibited the growth and metastasis of tumors and regulated metabolism and immunity in a CRC mouse model. Thus, AC may be an effective alternative treatment option for CRC.\",\n","       \"The association of social vulnerability with colorectal enhanced recovery program failure.BACKGROUND: Enhanced recovery programs (ERPs) improve outcomes, but over 20\\xa0% of patients fail ERP and the contribution of social vulnerability is unknown. This study aimed to characterize the association between social vulnerability and ERP adherence and failure. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of colorectal surgery patients between 2015 and 2020 utilizing ACS-NSQIP data. Patients who failed ERP (LOS\\xa0>\\xa06\\xa0days) were compared to patients not failing ERP. The CDC's social vulnerability index (SVI) was used to assess social vulnerability. RESULT: 273 of 1191 patients (22.9\\xa0%) failed ERP. SVI was a significant predictor of ERP failure (OR 4.6, 95\\xa0% CI 1.3-16.8) among those with >70\\xa0% ERP component adherence. SVI scores were significantly higher among patients non-adherent with 3 key ERP components: preoperative block (0.58 vs. 0.51, p\\xa0<\\xa00.01), early diet (0.57 vs. 0.52, p\\xa0=\\xa00.04) and early foley removal (0.55 vs. 0.50, p\\xa0<\\xa00.01). CONCLUSIONS: Higher social vulnerability was associated with non-adherence to 3 key ERP components as well as ERP failure among those who were adherent with >70\\xa0% of ERP components. Social vulnerability needs to be recognized, addressed, and included in efforts to further improve ERPs. KEY MESSAGE: Social vulnerability is associated with non-adherence to enhanced recovery components and ERP failure among those with high ERP adherence. Social vulnerability needs to be addressed in efforts to improve ERPs.\",\n","       'The role of unpaired image-to-image translation for stain color normalization in colorectal cancer histology classification.BACKGROUND: Histological assessment of colorectal cancer (CRC) tissue is a crucial and demanding task for pathologists. Unfortunately, manual annotation by trained specialists is a burdensome operation, which suffers from problems like intra- and inter-pathologist variability. Computational models are revolutionizing the Digital Pathology field, offering reliable and fast approaches for challenges like tissue segmentation and classification. With this respect, an important obstacle to overcome consists in stain color variations among different laboratories, which can decrease the performance of classifiers. In this work, we investigated the role of Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation (UI2IT) models for stain color normalization in CRC histology and compared to classical normalization techniques for Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) images. METHODS: Five Deep Learning normalization models based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) belonging to the UI2IT paradigm have been thoroughly compared to realize a robust stain color normalization pipeline. To avoid the need for training a style transfer GAN between each pair of data domains, in this paper we introduce the concept of training by exploiting a meta-domain, which contains data coming from a wide variety of laboratories. The proposed framework enables a huge saving in terms of training time, by allowing to train a single image normalization model for a target laboratory. To prove the applicability of the proposed workflow in the clinical practice, we conceived a novel perceptive quality measure, which we defined as Pathologist Perceptive Quality (PPQ). The second stage involved the classification of tissue types in CRC histology, where deep features extracted from Convolutional Neural Networks have been exploited to realize a Computer-Aided Diagnosis system based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM). To prove the reliability of the system on new data, an external validation set composed of N\\xa0=\\xa015,857 tiles has been collected at IRCCS Istituto Tumori \"Giovanni Paolo II\". RESULTS: The exploitation of a meta-domain consented to train normalization models that allowed achieving better classification results than normalization models explicitly trained on the source domain. PPQ metric has been found correlated to quality of distributions (Fréchet Inception Distance - FID) and to similarity of the transformed image to the original one (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity - LPIPS), thus showing that GAN quality measures introduced in natural image processing tasks can be linked to pathologist evaluation of H&E images. Furthermore, FID has been found correlated to accuracies of the downstream classifiers. The SVM trained on DenseNet201 features allowed to obtain the highest classification results in all configurations. The normalization method based on the fast variant of CUT (Contrastive Unpaired Translation), FastCUT, trained with the meta-domain paradigm, allowed to achieve the best classification result for the downstream task and, correspondingly, showed the highest FID on the classification dataset. CONCLUSIONS: Stain color normalization is a difficult but fundamental problem in the histopathological setting. Several measures should be considered for properly assessing normalization methods, so that they can be introduced in the clinical practice. UI2IT frameworks offer a powerful and effective way to perform the normalization process, providing realistic images with proper colorization, unlike traditional normalization methods that introduce color artifacts. By adopting the proposed meta-domain framework, the training time can be reduced, and the accuracy of downstream classifiers can be increased.',\n","       'Combination of vitamin D and probiotics inhibits chemically induced colorectal carcinogenesis in Wistar rats.The modulation of inflammatory elements, cell differentiation and proliferation by vitamin D and the role of probiotics in the intestinal microbiota and immunogenic response have sparked interest in the application of both in chemotherapeutics and chemoprevention of colorectal tumors. AIMS: The present study aimed to investigate the effects of isolated and/or combined treatment of vitamin D3 and probiotics on colorectal carcinogenesis. MAIN METHODS: Pre-neoplastic lesions were induced with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine in the colon of Wistar rats, which were treated with probiotics and/or vitamin D in three different approaches (simultaneous, pre-, and post-treatment). We investigated the frequency of aberrant crypt foci (ACF) and aberrant crypt (AC) in the distal colon, fecal microbiome composition, gene and protein expression through immunohistochemical and RT-PCR assays, and general toxicity through water consumption and weight gain monitoring. KEY FINDINGS: Results confirm the systemic safety of treatments, and show a protective effect of vitamin D and probiotics in all approaches studied, as well as in combined treatments, with predominance of different bacterial phyla compared to controls. Treated groups show different levels of Nrf2, GST, COX2, iNOS, β-catenin and PCNA expression. SIGNIFICANCE: These experimental conditions explore the combination of vitamin D and probiotics supplementation at low doses over pathways involved in distinct stages of colorectal carcinogenesis, with results supporting its application in prevention and long-term strategies.',\n","       'B13, a well-tolerated inhibitor of hedgehog pathway, exhibited potent anti-tumor effects against colorectal carcinoma in vitro and in vivo.Abnormal activation of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway mediates the genesis and progression of various tumors [1]. Currently, three drugs targeting the Hh signaling component Smoothened (Smo) have been marketed for the clinical treatment of basal cell tumors or acute myeloid leukemia. However, drug resistance is a common problem in those drugs, so the study of Smo inhibitors that can overcome drug resistance has important guiding significance for clinical adjuvant drugs. MTT assay, clone formation assay and EdU assay were used to detect the proliferation inhibitory activity of the drugs on tumor cells. The effect of B13 on cell cycle and apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry. An acute toxicity test was used to detect the toxicity of B13 in vivo, and xenograft tumor model was used to detect the efficacy of B13 in vivo. The binding of B13 to Smo was studied by BODIPY-cyclopamine competitive binding assay and molecular docking. The effect of B13 on the expression and localization of downstream target gene Gli1/2 of Smo was investigated by Western Blot and immunofluorescence assay. Smo(D473H) mutant cell line was constructed to study the effect of B13 against drug resistance. (1) B13 had the strongest inhibitory activity against colorectal cancer cells. (2) B13 can effectively inhibit the clone formation and EdU positive rate of colon cancer cells. (3) B13 can block the cell cycle in the G2/M phase and cell apoptosis. (4) B13 has low toxicity in vivo, and its efficacy in vivo is better than that of the Vismodegib. (5) Molecular docking and BODIPY-cyclopamine experiments showed that B13 could bind to Smo protein. (6) B13 can inhibit the protein expression of Gli1, the downstream of Smo, and inhibit its entry into the nucleus. (7) B13 could inhibit the expression of Gli1 in the HEK293 cells with Smo(D473H), and the molecular docking results showed that B13 could bind Smo(D473H) protein. B13 with the best anti-tumor activity was screened out by MTT assay. In vitro, pharmacodynamics experiments showed that B13 could effectively inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of colorectal cancer cells, induce cell cycle arrest, and induce cell apoptosis. In vivo pharmacodynamics experiments showed that B13 was superior to Vismodegib in antitumor activity and had low toxicity in vivo. Mechanism studies have shown that B13 can bind Smo protein, inhibit the expression of downstream Gli1 and its entry into the nucleus. Notably, B13 overcomes resistance caused by Smo(D473H) mutations.',\n","       'The mechanisms underlying the enrichment and action of glypican-1-positive exosomes in colorectal cancer cells.BACKGROUND: Glypican-1 (GPC1) is overexpressed in several tumors, and GPC1(+) exosomes have shown the potential to predict early colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the mechanisms underlying the enrichment and action of GPC1(+) exosomes in CRC remain unknown. METHODS: The expression of slit guidance ligand 2 (SLIT2), hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α/2α, and GPC1 in clinical CRC tissues was detected using immunohistochemistry and western blot. Exosomes were isolated from the supernatants of CRC cell cultures. The effects of SLIT2, hypoxia, heparin, and phospholipase C (PLC) on exosomal GPC1 expression and GPC1(+) exosome enrichment in CRC cells were analyzed with western blot and flow cytometry. CRC cell proliferation was assessed with MTT and colony formation assays. Co-immunoprecipitation was used to detect the binding of GPC1 and SLIT2 in SW480 cells. Nude mice were subcutaneously inoculated with SW480 cells with different treatments. The Wnt signaling was detected. RESULTS: SLIT2 was poorly expressed and GPC1, HIF-1α, and HIF-2α were highly expressed in human CRC tissues. SLIT2 in CRC cells inhibited GPC1(+) exosome enrichment and exosomal GPC1 expression. PLC and heparin increased GPC1(+) exosome enrichment in CRC cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Hypoxia increased the enrichment of GPC1(+) exosomes in CRC cells depending on HIF-2α expression. GPC1(+) exosomes stimulated CRC cell proliferation and xenograft tumor growth through activation of Wnt signaling. CONCLUSIONS: GPC1(+) exosome enrichment is related to PLC and heparin. Hypoxia increases the enrichment of GPC1(+) exosomes in CRC cells by activating HIF-2α and downregulating SLIT2. GPC1(+) exosomes further drive CRC progression by activating Wnt signaling.',\n","       'Label-free MIP-SERS biosensor for sensitive detection of colorectal cancer biomarker.Early diagnosis of colorectal cancer can significantly improve the overall survival rate of patients, thus selective and sensitive detection of biomarkers in serum samples is vital for early detection and dynamic monitoring of cancer. Nucleoside diphosphate kinase NM23-H2 (NDKB) is an important biomarker and therapeutic target for the diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, a label-free and ultrasensitive biosensor for NDKB protein markers is presented for the first time, combining the characteristic capture selectivity of molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) and the ultrasensitivity of surface-enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) technique. The imprinted cavity serves as the only channel for Raman reporter to approach the SERS substrate, providing highly complementary non-covalent binding sites that selectively capture the target protein based on ionic, hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic interactions. Specific recognition of the NDKB protein will perfectly fill the imprinted cavity, which makes it difficult for the Raman reporter to get close to the SERS substrate, and the Raman signal decreases significantly, while the proteins of other structural sizes can not match the imprinted cavity. Through the change of the Raman signal, the proposed biosensor can realize the ultra-sensitive detection of NDKB, and the limit of detection (LOD) is 0.82\\xa0pg/mL. Compared with the traditional immunoassay technology, this combined approach with the advantages of low cost, fast response, high sensitivity and selectivity, provides clinical application potential for the early diagnosis of CRC.',\n","       'Oxidative stress-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis induced by the acaricide, fenpyroximate, on cultured human colon cancer HCT 116 cells.Fenpyroximate (FEN) is an acaricide that inhibits mitochondrial electron transport at the NADH-coenzyme Q oxidoreductase (complex I). The present study was designed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underling FEN toxicity on cultured human colon carcinoma cells (HCT116). Our data showed that FEN induced HCT116 cell mortality in a concentration dependent manner. FEN arrested cell cycle in G0/G1 phase and increased DNA damage as assessed by comet assay. Induction of apoptosis was confirmed in HCT116 cells exposed to FEN by AO-EB staining and Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining assay. Moreover, FEN induced a loss in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), increased p53 and Bax mRNA expression and decreased bcl2 mRNA level. An increase in caspase 9 and caspase 3 activities was also detected. All toghether, these data suggest that FEN induce apoptosis in HCT116 cells via mitochondrial pathway. To check the implication of oxidative stress in FEN-induced cell toxicity, we examined the oxidative stress statue in HCT116 cells exposed to FEN and we tested the effect of a powerful antioxidant, N-acetylcystein (NAC), on FEN-caused toxicity. It was observed that FEN enhanced ROS generation and MDA levels and disturbed SOD and CAT activities. Besides, cell treatment with NAC significantly protected cells from mortality, DNA damage, loss of MMP, and caspase 3 activity induced by FEN. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing that FEN induced mitochondrial apoptosis via ROS generation and oxidative stress.',\n","       'Surgical efficacy and learning curves of laparoscopic complete mesocolic excision with intracorporeal anastomosis for right-sided colon cancer: A retrospective two-center cohort study.BACKGROUND: There is a potential benefit on long-term outcomes following complete mesocolic excision (CME) for right-sided colon cancer when compared to conventional colectomy. This study aims to analyze the learning curve and short-term outcomes of laparoscopic CME with intracorporeal anastomosis (ICA) for right-sided colon cancer in the hands of experienced colorectal surgeons. METHODS: A two-center cohort study of consecutive patients undergoing right-sided colectomy from September 2021 to May 2022 at two tertiary colorectal centers in Denmark. Learning curves of surgical time were estimated using a cumulative sum analysis (CUSUM). RESULTS: A total of 61 patients were included. According to the CUSUM analysis, 32 cases were needed to obtain a peak in operative time, resulting in a decrease in time consumption (group 1/learning phase: 217.2\\u2009min [SD 53.6] and group 2/plateau phase 191.6\\u2009min [SD 45.1], p\\u2009=\\u20090.05).

Little is known about the factors that underlie the impact of residential privilege on county-level cancer screening uptake. METHODS: Population-based cross-sectional study examining county-level data was obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's PLACES database, American Community Survey and the County Health Rankings and Roadmap database. The Index of Concentration of Extremes (ICE), a validated measure of racial and economic privilege, was examined relative to county-level rates of US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guideline-concordant screening for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers. Generalized structural equation modeling was used to determine the indirect and direct effects of ICE on cancer screening uptake. RESULTS: Across 3142 counties, county-level cancer screening rates demonstrated geographical variation ranging from 54.0% to 81.8% for breast cancer screening, from 39.8% to 74.4% for colorectal cancer screening, and from 69.9% to 89.7% for cervical cancer screening. Of note, cancer screening rates for breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer all increased from lower (ICE-Q1) to higher (ICE-Q4) privileged areas (breast: Q1\\u2009=\\u200971.0% vs. Q4\\u2009=\\u200972.2%; colorectal: Q1\\u2009=\\u200959.4% vs. Q4\\u2009=\\u200965.0%; cervical: Q1\\u2009=\\u200983.3% vs. Q4\\u2009=\\u200985.2%; all p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Mediation analysis revealed that the observed disparities between ICE and cancer screening uptake were explained by mediators such as poverty status, lack of health insurance or employment, urban-rural location and access to primary care physicians that accounted for 64% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 61%-67%), 85% (95% CI: 80%-89%), and 74% (95% CI: 71%-77%) of the effect on breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer screening, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In this cross-sectional study, the association between racial and economic privilege on USPSTF-recommended cancer screening was complex and influenced by an interplay of sociodemographic, geographical, and structural factors. Understanding the underlying area-level SDoH that mediate disparities in cancer prevention strategies can help focus interventions to improve equity in cancer prevention.\",\n","       'Comprehensive pan-cancer analysis identifies centromere-associated protein E as a novel prognostic and immunological biomarker in human tumors.Centromere-associated protein E (CENP-E), a core component of the kinetochore, mediates chromosome congression and spindle microtubule capture during mitosis. Partial experimental evidence has illustrated the carcinogenic effects of CENPE in tumors, but the corresponding pan-cancer analysis of CENPE still lacking. Based on public databases, including the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), and Human Protein Atlas (HPA), we take an array of bioinformatics methods to investigate the potential oncogenic roles of CENPE. Then, we validated CENPE, cell cycle-related proteins, and immune checkpoint molecule findings expression in clinical colon cancer samples by western blot. Our results showed that CENPE was up-regulated in almost all tumors, and the expression level of CENPE was associated with worse overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) in patients. The strong relationship between CENPE with gene mutation and MMR has also been validated. Moreover, CENPE gene expression was positively correlated with immune checkpoint molecular, and reversely correlated with infiltration levels of most immune cells. In the human colon cancer tissues, the expression of CENPE, cell cycle-related proteins, and immune checkpoint molecules were significantly higher than in the adjacent normal tissues. Our results indicated that CENPE can function as an oncogene in various cancers, and may be regarded as a promising prognostic and diagnostic biomarker in cancer treatment.',\n","       \"The hereditary N363K POLE exonuclease mutant extends PPAP tumor spectrum to glioblastomas by causing DNA damage and aneuploidy in addition to increased mismatch mutagenicity.The exonuclease domain of DNA polymerases epsilon's catalytic subunit (POLE) removes misincorporated nucleotides, called proofreading. POLE-exonuclease mutations cause colorectal- and endometrial cancers with an extreme burden of single nucleotide substitutions. We recently reported that particularly the hereditary POLE exonuclease mutation N363K predisposes in addition to aggressive giant cell glioblastomas. We knocked-in this mutation homozygously into human cell lines and compared its properties to knock-ins of the likewise hereditary POLE L424V mutation and to a complete proofreading-inactivating mutation (exo-null). We found that N363K cells have higher mutation rates as both L424V- or exo-null mutant cells. In contrast to L424V cells, N363K cells expose a growth defect, replication stress and DNA damage. In non-transformed cells, these burdens lead to aneuploidy but macroscopically normal nuclei. In contrast, transformed N363K cells phenocopy the enlarged and disorganized nuclei of giant cell glioblastomas. Taken together, our data characterize a POLE exonuclease domain mutant that not only causes single nucleotide hypermutation, but in addition DNA damage and chromosome instability, leading to an extended tumor spectrum. Our results expand the understanding of the polymerase exonuclease domain and suggest that an assessment of both the mutational potential and the genetic instability might refine classification and treatment of POLE-mutated tumors.\",\n","       'A comparison of the efficacy and safety of natural orifice specimen extraction and conventional laparoscopic surgery in patients with sigmoid colon/high rectal cancer.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of natural orifice specimen extraction surgery (NOSES) compared to conventional laparoscopic radical resection in the treatment of patients with sigmoid colon/high rectal cancer. METHODS: The control group (n\\u2009=\\u200962) underwent traditional laparoscopic radical resection, and the observation group (n\\u2009=\\u200962) underwent transanal NOSES laparoscopic radical resection. The operation length; amount of bleeding; number of lymph node dissections and days of hospitalization after surgery; visual pain scores on the first and third days after surgery; first leaving bed, anal exhaust, eating a liquid diet, and effective sleep times; and the postoperative complications (abdominal or incision infection or anastomotic fistula) of the two groups of patients were compared and analyzed. RESULTS: The effective sleep time of the observation group on the first day after the operation was 12.3\\u2009±\\u20092.9\\u2009h, which was longer than that of the control group (10.6\\u2009±\\u20093.2\\u2009h), and the difference was statistically significant (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). The pain degree of the two groups on the third day after the operation was lower than that on the first day, and the pain score of the observation group was lower than that of the control group (2.0\\u2009±\\u20091.0 vs. 3.2\\u2009±\\u20091.2, p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). The postoperative hospital stay in the observation group was significantly shorter than that in the control group (9.7\\u2009±\\u20092.3 vs. 11.2\\u2009±\\u20092.6, p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). The incidence of postoperative complications in the observation group was significantly lower than that in the control group (3.2% vs. 12.9%, p\\u2009=\\u20090.048). In addition, it was found that the first leaving bed, anal exhaust and liquid diet times in the observation group were significantly shorter than those in the control group (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic radical resection NOSES in patients with sigmoid colon cancer or high rectal cancer leads to lower postoperative pain and longer sleep time than in patients who undergo traditional laparoscopic radical surgery. The complication rate of this procedure is low, and the curative effect is safe and positive.',\n","       \"Association between the environmental quality index and textbook outcomes among Medicare beneficiaries undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer (CRC).BACKGROUND: Quality of cancer care received by individuals may be influenced by environmental factors resulting in inequalities within the healthcare system. We sought to investigate the association between the Environmental Quality Index (EQI) and achievement of textbook outcomes (TOs) among Medicare beneficiaries who underwent surgical resection for colorectal cancer (CRC). METHODS: Patients diagnosed with CRC from 2004 to 2015 were identified using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database and merged with the US Environmental Protection Agency's EQI data. A high EQI category indicated poor environmental quality, whereas a low EQI indicated better environmental conditions. RESULTS: Among 40\\u2009939 patients, 33\\u2009699 (82.3%) were diagnosed with colon cancer, 7240 (17.7%) were diagnosed with rectal cancer, and 652 (1.6%) were diagnosed with both cancers. Median age was 76 years old (interquartile range: 70-82 years) with roughly half of patients being female (n\\u2009=\\u200922\\u2009033, 53.8%). Most patients self-reported as White (n\\u2009=\\u200932\\u2009404, 79.2%) and resided in the West region of the United States (n\\u2009=\\u200920\\u2009308, 49.6%). On multivariable analysis, patients residing in high EQI areas were less likely to achieve TO (referent: low EQI; odds ratio [OR]: 0.94, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.89-0.99; p\\u2009=\\u20090.02). Of note, Black patients living in moderate-to-high EQI counties had a 31% decreased likelihood of reaching a TO compared with White patients in low EQI counties (OR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.55-0.87). CONCLUSION: Patients residing in high EQI counties and Black race were associated with a lower likelihood of TO following resection of CRC among Medicare patients. Environmental factors may be important contributors to health care disparities and affect postoperative outcomes following CRC resection.\",\n","       '\"Time\" for obesity-related cancer: The role of the circadian rhythm in cancer pathogenesis and treatment.The circadian rhythm is regulated by an intrinsic time-tracking system, composed both of a central and a peripheral clock, which influences the cycles of activities and sleep of an individual over 24\\xa0h. At the molecular level, the circadian rhythm begins when two basic helix-loop-helix/Per-ARNT-SIM (bHLH-PAS) proteins, BMAL-1 and CLOCK, interact with each other to produce BMAL-1/CLOCK heterodimers in the cytoplasm. The BMAL-1/CLOCK target genes encode for the repressor components of the clock, cryptochrome (Cry1 and Cry2) and the Period proteins (Per1, Per2 and Per3). It has been recently demonstrated that the disruption of circadian rhythm is associated with an increased risk of developing obesity and obesity-related diseases. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the disruption of the circadian rhythm plays a key role in tumorigenesis. Further, an association between the circadian rhythm disruptions and an increased incidence and progression of several types of cancer (e.g., breast, prostate, colorectal and thyroid cancer) has been found. As the perturbation of circadian rhythm has adverse metabolic consequences (e.g., obesity) and at the same time tumor promoter functions, this manuscript has the aim to report how the aberrant circadian rhythms affect the development and prognosis of different types of obesity-related cancers (breast, prostate, colon rectal and thyroid cancer) focusing on both human studies and on molecular aspects.',\n","       'The role of exercise in obesity-related cancers: Current evidence and biological mechanisms.Cancer ranks among the five leading causes of death in almost all countries and has important repercussions for individual and public health, the healthcare system, and society in general. Obesity increases the incidence of many types of cancer, but growing evidence suggests that physical activity may decrease risk for developing a variety of obesity-related cancer types, and, in some cases, may improve cancer prognosis and mortality rates. This review summarizes recent evidence on the effect of physical activity on obesity-related cancer prevention and survival. For some cancers, including breast, colorectal, and endometrial cancer, there is strong evidence for a preventative effect of exercise, but for many others, including gallbladder and kidney cancer, and multiple myeloma, evidence is inconsistent or largely lacking. Though many potential mechanisms have been proposed to explain the onco-protective effect of exercise, including improved insulin sensitivity, alterations in sex hormone availability, improved immune function and inflammation, myokine secretion, and modulation of intracellular signaling at the level of AMP kinase, the exact mechanism(s) of action within each cancer subtype remains poorly defined. Overall, a deeper understanding of how exercise can help against cancer and of the exercise parameters that can be altered to optimize exercise prescription is necessary and should be the subject of future investigation.',\n","       'Suppression of small nucleolar RNA host gene 8 (SNHG8) inhibits the progression of colorectal cancer cells.Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common gastrointestinal malignancies around the world with high mortality. Accumulating evidences demonstrate that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play critical roles in CRC tumorigenesis by regulating different pathways of carcinogenesis. SNHG8 (small nucleolar RNA host gene 8), a lncRNA, is highly expressed in several cancers and acts as an oncogene that promotes cancer progression. However, the oncogenic role of SNHG8 in CRC carcinogenesis and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we explored the role of SNHG8 in CRC cell lines by performing a series of functional experiments. Similar to the data reported in the Encyclopedia of RNA Interactome, our RT-qPCR results showed that SNHG8 expression was significantly upregulated in CRC cell lines (DLD-1, HT-29, HCT-116, and SW480) compared to the normal colon cell line (CCD-112CoN). We performed dicer-substrate siRNA transfection to knockdown the expression of SNHG8 in HCT-116 and SW480\\xa0cell lines which were expressing high levels of SNHG8. SNHG8 knockdown significantly reduced CRC cell growth and proliferation by inducing autophagy and apoptosis pathways through the AKT/AMPK/mTOR axis. We performed wound healing migration assay and demonstrated that SNHG8 knockdown significantly increased migration index in both cell lines, indicating reduced migration abilities of cells. Further investigation showed that SNHG8 knockdown suppresses epithelial to mesenchymal transition and reduces cellular migratory properties of CRC cells. Taken together, our study suggests that SNHG8 acts as an oncogene in CRC through the mTOR-dependent autophagy, apoptosis, and EMT pathways. Our study provides a better understanding the role of SNHG8 in CRC at molecular level and SNHG8 might be used as novel therapeutic target for CRC management.',\n","       'Effect of Spirituality-Based Palliative Care on Pain, Nausea,\\xa0Vomiting, and the\\xa0Quality of Life in Women with Colon Cancer: A Clinical Trial in Southern Iran.This randomized controlled clinical trial aimed to examine the effect of spirituality-based palliative care on pain, nausea,\\xa0vomiting, and the\\xa0quality of life in 80 Iranian colon cancer inpatients from January to June 2020 in southern Iran. Patients were randomly assigned to an intervention group and a control group. The intervention group took part in four 120-min sessions while the control group received standard care. Pain, nausea,\\xa0vomiting, and quality of life were assessed before the intervention and one month after the intervention. Data were analyzed using paired t-test and independent t-test. Between-groups differences analysis showed a significant difference in the quality of life scores, pain score, as well as nausea and vomiting scores following the one-month intervention. In conclusion, this group spirituality-based palliative care intervention might be beneficial in improving quality of life and reducing symptoms.',\n","       'Germline variation in RASAL2 may predict survival in patients with RAS-activated colorectal cancer.BACKGROUND: Therapeutic agents that specifically target patients with RAS mutant colorectal cancer (CRC) are needed. We sought potential drug targets by relating genome-wide association study and survival data in patients with advanced CRC profiled for mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway mutations. METHODS: In total, 694 patients from the clinical trials COIN and COIN-B had MAPK-activated CRCs (assigned as KRAS, NRAS, or BRAF mutant). Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), gene, and gene-set analyses were performed to identify determinants of survival. For rs12028023 in RAS protein activator-like 2 (RASAL2), we studied its effect by MAPK pathway activation status (by comparing to 760 patients without MAPK-activated CRCs), MAPK gene mutation status, surface area of the primary tumor (as a marker of proliferation), and expression on RASAL2. RESULTS: In MAGMA genome-wide analyses, RASAL2 was the most significant gene associated with survival (p\\xa0=\\xa02.0\\xa0×\\u200910(-5) ). Patients carrying the minor (A) allele in the lead SNP, rs12028023 in intron 1 of RASAL2, had a median increase in survival of 167\\u2009days as compared with patients carrying the major allele. rs12028023 was predictive for survival by MAPK-activation status (p(Z-test) \\xa0=\\u20092.1\\xa0×\\u200910(-3) ). Furthermore, rs12028023 improved survival in patients with RAS mutant (hazard ratio [HR]\\xa0=\\xa00.62, 95% confidence intervals [CI]\\xa0=\\xa00.5-0.8, p\\xa0=\\u20093.4\\xa0×\\u200910(-5) ) but not BRAF mutant (p\\xa0=\\u20090.87) CRCs.

A multidisciplinary ERAS protocol that includes preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative management guidelines was recently implemented at our urban, racially diverse, and academically affiliated community hospital. A delivery option was provided to reduce barriers to care. Given our unique patient population, the objective of our study was to determine if improvements in outcomes were reproducible in our hospital. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients undergoing elective colectomy at New York-Presbyterian Queens Hospital between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2020. Patient outcomes were compared between surgeries performed under standard practice (all colectomies prior to April 2017) and those performed after the implementation of the ERAS protocol. Demographic and perioperative data were abstracted from a prospectively derived database used to submit data to the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program. Additional data were obtained from chart review. RESULTS: Six hundred five elective colectomies were performed by 12 surgeons (range 1-228 cases) during the study period. Of these, 22 were performed open (41% followed ERAS), 467 were performed laparoscopically (57% followed ERAS), and 116 were performed robotically (74% followed ERAS). The average patient age was 64\\xa0y. Of which, 55% were male; 34% were Asian, 27% were non-Hispanic Caucasian, 27% were Hispanic, and 11% were Black or African American (all P-values > 0.05 for ERAS versus non-ERAS). Average duration of procedure was longer in the ERAS group (262\\xa0min versus 243\\xa0min, P\\xa0=\\xa00.04), although when stratified by procedure type, this relationship held true only for laparoscopic procedures. Hospital LOS was significantly shorter in the ERAS group (4.3 versus 5.4\\xa0d, P\\xa0<\\xa00.001) and this relationship held true for procedures performed both laparoscopically (4.2 versus 5.3\\xa0d, P\\xa0=\\xa00.01) and robotically (4.1 versus 5.1\\xa0d, P\\xa0=\\xa00.04). Of the ERAS group, patients who opted for delivery of ERAS components (n\\xa0=\\xa0205) had the shortest LOS when compared to patients who picked up components (n\\xa0=\\xa091) or opted out of ERAS (n\\xa0=\\xa0309) (4.1 versus 4.4 versus 5.2\\xa0d, P\\xa0=\\xa00.003). No significant differences were found for 30-d mortality, 30-d readmission, wound infection, or other postoperative complications (all P-values > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of an ERAS protocol in an urban, diverse, academically affiliated community hospital is associated with reductions in LOS for colectomies performed both laparoscopically and robotically. Facilitating ERAS compliance with a delivery option was also associated with improvements in hospital LOS. Preoperative nutrition supplementation was not associated with outcomes. No differences in mortality, readmission rates, or rates of postoperative complications were found.',\n","       \"Association of inflammatory bowel disease in first-degree relatives with risk of colorectal cancer: A nationwide case-control study in Sweden.This study aims to assess the association between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) history in first-degree relatives (FDRs) and colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. We conducted a nationwide case-control study in Sweden among 69\\u2009659 CRC cases and 343\\u2009032 non-CRC controls matched on age, sex, birth year and residence county. Through linkage of multi-generation register and the nationwide ESPRESSO (Epidemiology Strengthened by histoPathology Reports in Sweden) cohort, we ascertained IBD diagnoses among parents, full siblings and offspring of the index individuals. Odds ratios (ORs) of CRC associated with IBD family history were calculated using conditional logistic regression. 2.2% of both CRC cases (1566/69659) and controls (7676/343027) had ≥1 FDR with IBD history. After adjusting for family history of CRC, we observed no increased risk of CRC in FDRs of IBD patients (OR, 0.96; 95%CI, 0.91-1.02). The null association was consistent according to IBD subtype (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis), number of FDRs with IBD (1 or\\u2009≥\\u20092), age at first IBD diagnosis in FDRs (<18, 18-39, 40-59 or ≥60\\u2009years), maximum location/extent of IBD or FDR relation (parent, sibling or offspring). The null association remained for early-onset CRC (diagnosed at age <50\\u2009years). In conclusion, IBD history in FDRs was not associated with an increased risk of CRC. Our findings suggest that extra screening for CRC may not be needed in the offspring, siblings or parents of IBD patients, and strengthen the theory that it is the actual inflammation or atypia of the colon in IBD patients that confers the increased CRC risk.\",\n","       'LncRNA PROX1 antisense RNA 1 promotes PD-L1-mediated proliferation, metastasis, and immune escape in colorectal cancer by interacting with miR-520d.It was recently found that lncRNA PROX1 antisense RNA 1 (PROX1-AS1) manifested oncogenicity in a variety of malignancies. This work intended to investigate the molecular mechanisms of PROX1-AS1 in colorectal cancer (CRC) development and immune evasion. In this study, both PROX1-AS1 and PD-L1 expressions were lifted in CRC tissues and cells. PROX1-AS1 interference restrained CRC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, as well as CD8 + T-lymphocyte apoptosis, but increased the cytotoxicity and percentage of CD8 + T lymphocytes. The inhibitory effects of PROX1-AS1 inhibition on CRC progression and immune escape were positively related to PD-L1 suppression. PROX1-AS1 absorbed miR-520d to upregulate PD-L1 expression. PROX1-AS1 facilitated CRC progression and immune escape by targeting miR-520d. Furthermore, PROX1-AS1 deletion impaired CRC tumor growth in vivo . To sum up, this study affirmed that PROX1-AS1 could absorb miR-520d to upregulate PD-L1 in CRC, thereby promoting tumor progression and immune escape.',\n","       \"Statewide Examination of Access to Cancer Surgery During the COVID-19 Pandemic.INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic caused interruptions in the delivery of medical care across a wide range of conditions including cancer. Trends in surgical treatment for cancer during the pandemic have not been well described. We sought to characterize associations between the pandemic and access to surgical treatment for breast, colorectal, and lung cancer in Illinois. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study evaluating inpatient admissions at Illinois hospitals providing surgical care for lung cancer (n\\xa0=\\xa01913 cases, n\\xa0=\\xa064 hospitals), breast cancer (n\\xa0=\\xa0910 cases, n\\xa0=\\xa0108 hospitals), and colorectal cancer (n\\xa0=\\xa05339 cases, n\\xa0=\\xa0144 hospitals). Using discharge data from the Illinois Health and Hospital Association's Comparative Health Care and Hospital Data Reporting Services database, average monthly surgical case volumes were compared from 2019 to 2020. We also compared rates of cancer surgery for each cancer type, by patient characteristics, and hospital type across the three time periods using Pearson chi-squared and ANOVA testing as appropriate. Three discrete time periods were considered: prepandemic (7-12/2019), primary pandemic (4-6/2020), and pandemic recovery (7-12/2020). Hospital characteristics evaluated included hospital type (academic, community, safety net), COVID-19 burden, and baseline cancer surgery volume. RESULTS: There were 2096 fewer operations performed for breast, colorectal, and lung cancer in 2020 than 2019 in Illinois, with the greatest reductions in cancer surgery volume occurring at the onset of the pandemic in April (colorectal, -48.3%; lung, -13.1%) and May (breast, -45.2%) of 2020. During the pandemic, breast (-14.6%) and colorectal (-13.8%) cancer surgery experienced reductions in volume whereas lung cancer operations were more common (+26.4%) compared to 2019. There were no significant differences noted in gender, race, ethnicity, or insurance status among patients receiving oncologic surgery during the primary pandemic or pandemic recovery periods. Academic hospitals, hospitals with larger numbers of COVID-19 admissions, and those with greater baseline cancer surgery volumes were associated with the greatest reduction in cancer surgery during the primary pandemic period (all cancer types, P\\xa0<\\xa00.01). During the recovery period, hospitals with greater baseline breast and lung cancer surgery volumes remained at reduced surgery volumes compared to their counterparts (P\\xa0<\\xa00.01). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with significant reductions in breast and colorectal cancer operations in Illinois, while lung cancer operations remained relatively consistent. Overall, there was a net reduction in cancer surgery that was not made up during the recovery period. Academic hospitals, those caring for more COVID-19 patients, and those with greater baseline surgery volumes were most vulnerable to reduced surgery rates during peaks of the pandemic and to delays in addressing the backlog of cases.\",\n","       'Comment on: Clinical and molecular features of pediatric cancer patients with Lynch syndrome.nan',\n","       'Prediagnostic serum glyceraldehyde-derived advanced glycation end products and mortality among colorectal cancer patients.Glyceraldehyde-derived advanced glycation end products (glycer-AGEs) could contribute to colorectal cancer development and progression due to their pro-oxidative and pro-inflammatory properties. However, the association of glycer-AGEs with mortality after colorectal cancer diagnosis has not been previously investigated. Circulating glycer-AGEs were measured by competitive ELISA. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations of circulating glycer-AGEs concentrations with CRC-specific and all-cause mortality among 1034 colorectal cancer (CRC) cases identified within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study between 1993 and 2013. During a mean of 48\\u2009months of follow-up, 529 participants died (409 from CRC). Glycer-AGEs were statistically significantly positively associated with CRC-specific (HR(Q5 vs Q1) \\xa0=\\u20091.53, 95% CI: 1.04-2.25, P(trend) =\\u2009.002) and all-cause (HR(Q5 vs Q1) \\xa0=\\u20091.62, 95% CI: 1.16-2.26, P(trend) <\\u2009.001) mortality among individuals with CRC. There was suggestion of a stronger association between glycer-AGEs and CRC-specific mortality among patients with distal colon cancer (per SD increment: HR(proximal colon) \\xa0=\\u20091.02, 95% CI: 0.74-1.42; HR(distal colon) \\xa0=\\u20091.51, 95% CI: 1.20-1.91; P(effect modification) =\\u2009.02).

We are attempting to determine the clinical relevance of the mechanisms controlling the microRNA (miR-215 and miR-146a) expression and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)/interleukin-6 (IL-6) in a cross-link axis between obesity and colorectal cancer (CRC). Study participants were divided into four groups: healthy controls; obese without colorectal cancer; non-obese colorectal cancer; and obese with colorectal cancer. Obese and CRC patients had markedly higher expression of IL-6 and TGF-β, as well as tumor biomarkers, such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen 19.9 (CA19.9), and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels. The relative expression of microRNAs (miR-215 and miR-146a) was significantly lower in obese patients with colorectal cancer. BMI and the microRNAs(miR-215 and miR-146a) showed a substantial negative correlation. TGF-β was favorably linked with IL-6, cholesterol, triglyceride levels, and BMI. High levels of TGF-β and IL-6 in the blood indicate how intensely inflammation develops in obesity, which could increase the risk of colorectal cancer.',\n","       'Comments on \"Epidemiology of overall and early-onset serrated polyps versus conventional adenomas in a colonoscopy screening cohort\".nan',\n","       'Copper-cysteamine nanoparticle-mediated microwave dynamic therapy improves cancer treatment with induction of ferroptosis.Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) holds a great promise for cancer patients, however, due to the hypoxic characteristics of most solid tumors and the limited penetration depth of light in tissues, the extensive clinical application of PDT is limited. Herein, we report microwave induced copper-cysteamine (Cu-Cy) nanoparticles-based PDT as a promising cancer treatment to overcome cancer resistance in combination with ferroptosis. The treatment efficiency of Cu-Cy-mediated microwave dynamic therapy (MWDT) tested on HCT15 colorectal cancer (CRC) cells via cell titer-blue cell viability assay and live/dead assay reveal that Cu-Cy upon MW irradiation can effectively destroy HCT15 CRC cells with average IC-50 values of 20\\xa0μg/mL. The cytotoxicity of Cu-Cy to tumor cells after MW stimulation can be alleviated by ferroptosis inhibitor. Furthermore, Cu-Cy mediated MWDT could deplete glutathione peroxide 4 (GPX4) and enhance lipid peroxides (LPO) and malondialdehyde (MDA). Our findings demonstrate that MW-activated Cu-Cy killed CRC cells by inducing ferroptosis. The superior in vivo antitumor efficacy of the Cu-Cy was corroborated by a HCT15 tumor-bearing mice model. Immunohistochemical experiments showed that the GPX4 expression level in Cu-Cy\\xa0+\\xa0MW group was significantly lower than that in other groups.

Barriers to cervical and colorectal cancer screening and attitudes to promotion of self-sampling kits upon attendance for breast cancer screening.OBJECTIVES: To explore barriers to cervical and colorectal cancer screening and attitudes to promotion of self-sampling kits upon attendance for breast cancer screening. METHODS: Interview study with women who had not responded to one or more invitations to cervical or colorectal cancer screening. A semi-structured interview guide was used and interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Concepts from Temporal Motivation Theory were used to structure and analyse the data. RESULTS: Twenty-two women were interviewed. Screening was highly valued but the women perceived screening for cervical cancer and colorectal cancer as more troublesome to participate in, compared with participation in breast cancer screening. The lack of a pre-booked appointment or a suggested deadline attenuated the perceived value of cervical and colorectal cancer screening and this further increased procrastination. Promotion of self-sampling kits for cervical and colorectal cancer screening upon attendance for breast cancer screening was considered a feasible way to increase salience of both types of screening. CONCLUSION: A high number of micro steps and absence of a deadline in cervical and colorectal cancer screening diverted attention away from screening participation in cervical and colorectal cancer screening. The main facilitator could be reduction of micro actions, proposing a suggested deadline, and promotion of self-sampling kits when attending breast cancer screening to increase salience and a renewed attention to all three screening programmes.',\n","       'Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on colorectal cancer screening in New York City.BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the delivery of cancer screening. The resulting decrease in outpatient visits and cancellations of non-urgent procedures have negatively affected colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. We aimed to determine the effect of the pandemic on CRC screening at a safety-net hospital and a private health system based in New York City. METHODS: We identified individuals eligible for CRC screening aged 50 to 75 years presenting for outpatient care at a safety-net public hospital and private health system in April through September of 2019 and 2020. The primary outcome was the proportion of screening-eligible patients seen in primary care who underwent CRC screening. RESULTS: The safety-net hospital had 516 (6.1% of screening-eligible individuals) and 269 (4.3%) screening tests completed in 2019 and 2020, respectively (p < 0.01). Fecal immunochemical tests (FIT) accounted for 69.6% of screening in 2019 and 88.1% in 2020. Colonoscopy accounted for 20.3% of screening in 2019 and 11.9% in 2020.

Colonoscopy accounted for 38.1% of screening in 2019 and 42.9% in 2020. CONCLUSION: Absolute numbers of screening tests decreased for both institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic. We observed a decrease in screening uptake and increase in proportional FIT use in the safety-net hospital but no change in the private health system.',\n","       'Targeting the (pro)renin receptor in cancers: from signaling to pathophysiological effects.Cancer is a major public health problem, currently affecting hundreds of millions of people worldwide, and its clinical results are unpredictable, partly due to the lack of reliable biomarkers of cancer progression. Recently, it has been reported that (pro)renin receptor (PRR), as a new biomarker, plays an important role in different types of cancer, such as colorectal cancer, breast cancer, glioma, aldosterone-producing adenoma, endometrial cancer, urothelial cancer, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. In order to comprehensively and systematically understand the relationship and role of PRR with various cancers, this review will summarize the current research on targeting PRR in cancer from signaling to pathophysiological effects,\\xa0including the correlation between PRR/sPRR expression level and different cancers, potential mechanisms regulated by PRR in the progress of cancers, and PRR in cancer treatment. PRR can be a novel and promising biomarker and potential therapeutic target for diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis in cancer, which is worthy of extensive development and application in clinics.',\n","       'The Supplement of Magnesium Element to Inhibit Colorectal Tumor Cells.Magnesium ions are essential elements to the human body, with a daily intake of about 350\\xa0mg for an adult. Recently, a meta-analysis reported that magnesium ion intake is related to a reduced risk of colorectal tumors. In addition, implantation of biodegradable magnesium pins after colorectal tumor resection could potentially inhibit the residual tumor cells. These impressive results implied that magnesium ions possess inhibitory properties against colorectal carcinoma. However, this hypothesis has yet to be confirmed by experimental results. In this work, different concentrations of magnesium ions were modulated to investigate their inhibitory effects on cell viability through cell cycle arrest, subsequently inducing apoptosis by activating the caspase-3 pathway. The animal experiments revealed that magnesium injection restricted tumor growth after 3\\xa0weeks of treatment compared to the control group. According to the immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy results, the remarkable effect may be attributed to promoting the apoptotic rate of tumor cells. The evidence highlights the potential for the clinical use of magnesium implants to inhibit the growth of residual cells after colorectal tumor surgery.',\n","       'Metabolic pathway-based molecular subtyping of colon cancer reveals clinical immunotherapy potential and prognosis.PURPOSE: Colon cancer presents challenges to clinical diagnosis and management due to its high heterogeneity. For more efficient and convenient diagnosis and treatment of colon cancer, we are committed to characterizing the molecular features of colon cancer by pioneering a classification system based on metabolic pathways. METHODS: Based on the 113 metabolic pathways and genes collected in the previous stage, we scored and filtered the metabolic pathways of each sample in the training set by ssGSEA, and obtained 16 metabolic pathways related to colon cancer recurrence. In consistent clustering of training set samples with recurrence-related metabolic pathway scores, we identified two robust molecular subtypes of colon cancer (MC1 and MC2). Furthermore, we performed multi-angle analysis on the survival differences of subtypes, metabolic characteristics, clinical characteristics, functional enrichment, immune infiltration, differences with other subtypes, stemness indices, TIDE prediction, and drug sensitivity, and finally constructed colon cancer prognostic model. RESULTS: The results showed that the MC1 subtype had a poor prognosis based on higher immune activity and immune checkpoint gene expression. The MC2 subtype is associated with high metabolic activity and low expression of immune checkpoint genes and a better prognosis. The MC2 subtype was more responsive to PD-L1 immunotherapy than the MC1 subclass. However, we did not observe significant differences in tumor mutational burden between the two. CONCLUSION: Two molecular subtypes of colon cancer based on metabolic pathways have distinct immune signatures. Constructing prognostic models based on subtype differential genes provides valuable reference for personalized therapy targeting unique tumor metabolic signatures.',\n","       'FOSL2 promotes intertumoral infiltration of T cells and increases pathological complete response rates in locally advanced rectal cancer patients.The outcome of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) remains highly unpredictable for individuals with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). We set out to characterize effective biomarkers that promote a pathological complete response (pCR). We quantified the abundances of 6483 high-confidence proteins in pre-nCRT biopsies of 58 LARC patients from two hospitals with pressure cycling technology (PCT)-assisted pulse data-independent acquisition (PulseDIA) mass spectrometry. Compared with non-pCR patients, pCR patients achieved long-term disease-free survival (DFS) and had higher tumor immune infiltration, especially CD8(+) T cell infiltration, before nCRT. FOSL2 was selected as the candidate biomarker for predicting pCR and was found to be significantly upregulated in pCR patients, which was verified in another 54 pre-nCRT biopsies of LARC patients by immunohistochemistry. FOSL2 expression was able to predict pCR by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) with high efficiency (Area under curve (AUC)\\xa0=\\xa00.939, specificity\\xa0=\\xa01.000, sensitivity\\xa0=\\xa00.850), and high FOSL2 expression was associated with long-term DFS (p\\xa0=\\xa00.044). When treated with simulated nCRT, FOSL2 sufficiency resulted in more significant inhibition of cell proliferation, and more significant promotion of cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis. Moreover, CXCL10 secretion with abnormal cytosolic dsDNA accumulation was found in FOSL2-wildtype (FOSL2-WT) tumor cells over nCRT, which might elevate CD8(+) T-cell infiltration and CD8(+) T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity to promote nCRT-induced antitumor immunity. Our study revealed proteomic profiles in LARC patients before nCRT and highlighted immune activation in the tumors of patients who achieved pCR. We identified FOSL2 as a promising biomarker to predict pCR and promote long-term DFS by contributing to CD8(+) T-cell infiltration.',\n","       'Slow skeletal muscle troponin T acts as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for hepatocellular carcinoma.Slow skeletal muscle troponin T (TNNT1) as a poor prognostic indicator is upregulated in colon and breast cancers. However, the role of TNNT1 in the disease prognosis and biological functions of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still unclear. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), immunoblot, and immunohistochemical analyses were applied to evaluate the TNNT1 expression of human HCC. The impact of TNNT1 levels on disease progression and survival outcome was studied using TCGA analysis. Moreover, the bioinformatics analysis and HCC cell culture were used to investigate the biological functions of TNNT1. Besides, the immunoblot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to detect the extracellular TNNT1 of HCC cells and circulating TNNT1 of HCC patients, respectively. The effect of TNNT1 neutralization on oncogenic behaviors and signaling was further validated in the cultured hepatoma cells. In this study, tumoral and blood TNNT1 was upregulated in HCC patients based on the analyses using bioinformatics, fresh tissues, paraffin sections, and serum. From the multiple bioinformatics tools, the TNNT1 overexpression was associated with advanced stage, high grade, metastasis, vascular invasion, recurrence, and poor survival outcome in HCC patients. By the cell culture and TCGA analyses, TNNT1 expression and release were positively correlated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) processes in HCC tissues and cells. Moreover, TNNT1 neutralization suppressed oncogenic behaviors and EMT in hepatoma cells. In conclusion, TNNT1 may serve as a non-invasive biomarker and drug target for HCC management. This research finding may provide a new insight for HCC diagnosis and treatment.',\n","       \"Carboxypeptidase A6 suppresses the proliferation and invasion of colorectal cancer cells and is negatively regulated by miR-96-3p.BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignant tumor, and this study aims to explore the role and the regulatory mechanism of carboxypeptidase A6 (CPA6) in CRC cells. METHODS: Specific shRNA targeting CPA6 mRNA was transfected into NCM460 and HT29\\xa0cells to down-regulate CPA expression, and expression plasmid was transfected into HCT116\\xa0cells to exogenously overexpress CPA6. The dual luciferase assay was used to detect the direct binding of miR-96-3p to CPA6 3'UTR. Phosphorylation and activation of Akt were detected using Western blot. Cells were treated with miR-96-3p mimics, Akt inhibitor (MK-2206) or agonist (SC79) for rescue experiments. The cell functions were evaluated using CCK-8, clone formation, transwell, and Western blot assays. Xenograft tumor assay was also used to analyze the effect of altered CPA6 expression on tumor growth. RESULTS: Knockdown of CPA6 promoted the proliferation, clone formation, migration, and invasion of NCM460 and HT29\\xa0cells in vitro, and the tumor growth of nude mouse xenograft tumor in vivo. Moreover, over-expression of CPA6 significantly inhibited the malignant proliferation and invasion of HCT116\\xa0cells in vitro, and the tumor growth of xenograft tumor in vivo. Furthermore, miR-96-3p could directly regulate CPA6 expression by targeting its 3'UTR, and miR-96-3p mimics rescued the inhibitory effects of CPA6 overexpression on the malignant proliferation and invasion of CRC cells. Finally, CPA6 knockdown enhanced Akt/mTOR phosphorylation and activation, while CPA6 overexpression inhibited Akt/mTOR activation. The regulatory effect of CPA6 on Akt/mTOR signaling was naturally regulated by miR-96-3p. Akt inhibitor or agonist rescued the effects of CPA6 knockdown or overexpression on proliferation and EMT of colon cancer cells. CONCLUSION: CPA6 has a significant tumor suppressive effect on CRC by inhibiting the activation of Akt/mTOR signaling, and miR-96-3p negatively regulates the expression of CPA6.\",\n","       'Development of new TAK-285 derivatives as potent EGFR/HER2 inhibitors possessing antiproliferative effects against 22RV1 and PC3 prostate carcinoma cell lines.Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein tyrosine kinases co-expressed in various cancers such as ovarian, breast, colon, and prostate subtypes. Herein, new TAK-285 derivatives (9a-h) were synthesised, characterised, and biologically evaluated as dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitors. Compound 9f exhibited IC(50) values of 2.3\\u2009nM over EGFR and 234\\u2009nM over HER2, which is 38-fold of staurosporine and 10-fold of TAK-285 over EGFR. Compound 9f also showed high selectivity profile when tested over a small kinase panel. Compounds 9a-h showed IC(50) values in the range of 1.0-7.3\\u2009nM and 0.8-2.8\\u2009nM against PC3 and 22RV1 prostate carcinoma cell lines, respectively. Cell cycle analysis, apoptotic induction, molecular docking, dynamics, and MM-GBSA studies confirmed the plausible mechanism(s) of compound 9f as a potent EGFR/HER2 dual inhibitor with an effective antiproliferative action against prostate carcinoma.',\n","       'Novel Glu-based pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine analogues: design, synthesis and biological evaluation as DHFR and TS dual inhibitors.A novel series of multifunctional pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine-based glutamate analogs (6a-l and 7a,b) have been designed and synthesized as antifolate anticancer agents. Among the tested compounds, 6i exhibited the most potent anti-proliferative activity towards NSCLC, CNS, Ovarian, Prostate, Colon, Melanoma, Breast, and Renal cancers with good to weak cytostatic activity and non-lethal actions. 6i demonstrated higher selectivity for cancer than normal cells. 6i could significantly increase the accumulation of S-phase cells during the cell cycle distribution of cancer cells with high potency in the induction of apoptosis. The results unveiled that 6i probably acts through dual inhibition of DHFR and TS enzymes (IC(50) = 2.41 and 8.88\\u2009µM, correspondingly). Docking studies of 6i displayed that N1-p-bromophenyl and C3-Methyl groups participate in substantial hydrophobic interactions. The drug-likeness features inferred that 6i met the acceptance criteria of Pfizer. Taking together, 6i could be a promising prototype for further optimization as an effective anticancer drug.',\n","       'Association between body mass index, metabolic syndrome and common urologic conditions: a cross-sectional study using a large multi-institutional database from the United States.INTRODUCTION: The study aims to determine whether body mass index (BMI), metabolic syndrome (MS) or its individual components (primary hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemias) are risk factors for common urological diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study with data collected on February 28, 2022 from the TriNetX Research Network. Patients were divided in cohorts according to their BMI, presence of MS (BMI > 30\\u2009kg/m(2), type 2 diabetes mellitus, primary hypertension and disorders of lipoprotein metabolism) and its individual components and its association with common urological conditions was determined. For each analysis, odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Statistical significance was assessed at p\\u2009<\\u2009.05. RESULTS: BMI\\u2009>\\u200930\\u2009kg/m(2) was associated with increased risk of lithiasis, kidney cancer, overactive bladder, male hypogonadism, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and erectile dysfunction (p\\u2009<\\u2009.05). On the contrary, BMI was inversely associated with ureteral, bladder and prostate cancer (p\\u2009<\\u2009.05). In all urological diseases, MS was the strongest risk factor, with prostate cancer (OR = 2.53) showing the weakest and male hypogonadism the strongest (OR\\u2009=\\u200913.00) associations. CONCLUSIONS: MS and its individual components were significant risk factors for common urological conditions. Hence holistic approaches with lifestyle modification might prevent common urological disease.Key messagesOverall, metabolic syndrome is the strongest risk factor for all the analysed urological diseases.Abnormally high body mass index can be a risk or protective factor depending on the threshold and urological disease that are being evaluated.Metabolic syndrome and increased BMI should be considered important factors associated to the prevalence of common urological diseases.',\n","       'A Modified Net Reclassification Improvement Statistic.The continuous net reclassification improvement (NRI) statistic is a popular model change measure that was developed to assess the incremental value of new factors in a risk prediction model. Two prominent statistical issues identified in the literature call the utility of this measure into question: (1) it is not a proper scoring function and (2) it has a high false positive rate when testing whether new factors contribute to the risk model. For binary response regression models, these subjects are interrogated and a modification of the continuous NRI, guided by the likelihood-based score residual, is proposed to address these issues. Within a nested model framework, the modified NRI may be viewed as a distance measure between two risk models. An application of the modified NRI is illustrated using prostate cancer data.',\n","       'Application of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in men over 75 years: an analysis of comparative outcomes.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to summarize the current evidence regarding the feasibility of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) in men aged over 75\\u2009years. METHOD: A comprehensive search of four electronic databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure, PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library) was performed to identify eligible comparative studies as of April 2022. Parameters, including perioperative results and oncological and functional outcomes, were evaluated. RESULTS: Seven articles with 7575 patients undergoing RARP were included in this study. Patients with prostate cancer were grouped by age ≥ 75\\u2009years versus < 75\\u2009years. Our results demonstrated that compared with the older group, the younger group had better potency (p\\u2009<\\u2009.00001). However, there were no significant differences in operation time (p\\u2009=\\u2009.29), estimated blood loss (p\\u2009=\\u2009.13), length of hospital stay (p\\u2009=\\u2009.48), complications (p\\u2009=\\u2009.22), continence (p\\u2009=\\u2009.21), positive surgical margin (p\\u2009=\\u2009.28), and biochemical recurrence (p\\u2009=\\u2009.74) between the groups. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that the perioperative, oncological, and functional outcomes in men aged over 75\\u2009years undergoing RARP were not significantly different from those of their younger counterparts.

When CaP progressed to castration-resistant CaP (CRPC), the prognosis is poor. Although CaP/CRPC and BPH frequently coexist in prostate, the inter-relational mechanism between them is largely unknown. METHODS: Single-cell RNA sequencing, bulk-RNA sequencing, and microarray data of BPH, CaP in the Gene Expression Omnibus database were obtained and comprehensively analyzed. Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and lasso regression analysis were performed to explore the potential biomarkers. RESULTS: With WGCNA, five modules in BPH, two in CaP, and three in CRPC were identified as significant modules. Pathway enrichment analysis found that the epigenetics and chromosomal-related signaling were dominantly clustered in the CaP group but not in BPH and CRPC. Lasso regression analysis was used to analyze further the mutual genes between the BPH module and the CRPC module. As a result, DDA1, ERG28, OGFOD1, and OXA1L were significantly correlated with the transcriptomic features in both BPH and CRPC. More importantly, the role of the four gene signatures was validated in two independent anti-PD-1 immunotherapy cohort. CONCLUSION: This study revealed the shared gene signatures and immune microenvironment between BPH and CRPC. The identified hub genes, including DDA1, ERG28, OGFOD1, and OXA1L, might be potential therapeutic targets for facilitating immunotherapy in prostate cancer.',\n","       'Risk analysis of metformin use in prostate cancer: a national population-based study.INTRODUCTION: Various approaches are required to prevent and treat heterogeneity-based prostate cancer. Here, we analyzed the anticancer effects of metformin, which has a good toxicity profile and is inexpensive. METHOD: From January 2010 to December 2019, analysis was conducted retrospectively in a cohort from the National Health Insurance Service database. The wash-out period was set for cancer diagnosis in 2010 and 2011, and subjects (105,279) diagnosed with prostate cancer (ICD C61) from 2012 to 2014 were excluded The final subjects (105,216) were defined as the metformin administration group when they took metformin for 180\\u2009days or more from January 2012 to December 2019. The non-metformin group was defined as those who took less than 180\\u2009days from January 2012 to December 2019. The prevalence of prostate cancer according to metformin administration and the risk according to the cumulative duration of metformin were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 105,216 people were included in this study, with 59,844 in the metformin group and 45,372 in the metformin non-administration group. When calculating HRs (Hazard Rate) according to the cumulative period of metformin administration, metformin administration period length was inversely associated with prostate cancer risk (Q2\\u2009HR = 0.791 95% CI: 0.773-0.81, Q3\\u2009HR = 0.634 95% CI: 0.62-0.649, Q4\\u2009HR = 0.571 95% CI: 0.558-0.585). HRs tended to decrease with the cumulative duration of metformin administration. CONCLUSION: This study confirmed that prostate cancer risk decreased with increasing duration of metformin administration.

Surgical and medical co-management (SMC) is a new strategy to improve patients' healthcare outcomes in surgical settings. METHODS: We reviewed the clinical data of older patients with chronic diseases who were cared for with SMC undergoing RRP in our hospital in the past 3\\u2009years and compared them with the clinical data from the general urology ward. Preoperative conditions and related indicators of recovery, and incidence of postoperative complications with the Clavien Grade System were compared between these two groups. RESULTS: The indicators of recovery were significantly better, and the incidence rates of complications were significantly reduced in the SMC group at grades I-IV (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05), as compared to the general urology ward group. CONCLUSIONS: The provision of care by SMC for older patients focused on early identification, comorbidity management, preoperative optimization, and collaborative management would significantly improve surgical outcomes. The SMC strategy is worthy of further clinical promotion in RRP treatment in older men with chronic diseases and complex medical conditions.\",\n","       \"CircDHRS3 inhibits prostate cancer cell proliferation and metastasis through the circDHRS3/miR-421/MEIS2 axis.Prostate cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer among men worldwide. The importance of circular RNA (circRNA) in prostate cancer and its connection to malignancy has been steadily recognized. circRNA expression was obtained by circRNA sequencing of prostate cancer. circRNA and its function were further analysed. The results were verified by qRT-PCR, RIP assay, FISH, RNA pulldown, WB, CCK-8, colony formation assay and wound-healing assay. BALB/c Nude mice were used for xenograft hosts. Low expression of circDHRS3 was assessed in prostate cancer. Overexpression of circDHRS3 inhibited prostate cancer growth and migration in vitro. Additionally, miR-421 was shown to be the downstream target of circDHRS3, as shown by fluorescence in situ hybridization and dual-luciferase experiments. The rescue assay results for the PC3 and Du145 cell lines demonstrated that circDHRS3 inhibits prostate cancer cell lines' ability to proliferate and metastasize by modulating MEIS2 expression through the circDHRS3/miR-421/MEIS2 axis. In vivo investigations confirmed that the overexpression of circDHRS3 could inhibit both the lung and bone metastasis of prostate cancer cells. circDHRS3 has the potential to become a biomarker and a targeted therapeutic site for prostate cancer, particularly in the malignant stage. Our study indicates that circDHRS3 inhibits prostate cancer cell proliferation and metastasis through the circDHRS3/miR-421/MEIS2 axis.\",\n","       'Simultaneous administration of EZH2 and BET inhibitors inhibits proliferation and clonogenic ability of metastatic prostate cancer cells.Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a common treatment for recurrent prostate cancer (PC). However, after a certain period of responsiveness, ADT resistance occurs virtually in all patients and the disease progresses to lethal metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Aberrant expression and function of the epigenetic modifiers EZH2 and BET over activates c-myc, an oncogenic transcription factor critically contributing to mCRPC. In the present work, we tested, for the first time, the combination of an EZH2 inhibitor with a BET inhibitor in metastatic PC cells. The combination outperformed single drugs in inhibiting cell viability, cell proliferation and clonogenic ability, and concomitantly reduced both c-myc and NF-kB expression. Although these promising results will warrant further in\\xa0vivo validation, they represent the first step to establishing the rationale that the proposed combination might be suitable for mCRPC treatment, by exploiting molecular targets different from androgen receptor.',\n","       'Discovery of new pyridine-quinoline hybrids as competitive and non-competitive PIM-1 kinase inhibitors with apoptosis induction and caspase 3/7 activation capabilities.New quinoline-pyridine hybrids were designed and synthesised as PIM-1/2 kinase inhibitors.

However, most prostate MRF studies were performed with spiral acquisitions that are sensitive to B0 inhomogeneities and consequent blurring. In this work, a radial MRF acquisition with a novel subspace reconstruction technique was developed to enable fast T1/T2 mapping in the prostate in under 4 min. The subspace reconstruction exploits the extensive temporal correlations in the MRF dictionary to pre-compute a low dimensional space for the solution and thus reduce the number of radial spokes to accelerate the acquisition. Iterative reconstruction with the subspace model and additional regularization of the signal representation in the subspace is performed to minimize the number of spokes and maintain matching quality and SNR. Reconstruction accuracy was assessed using the ISMRM NIST phantom. In-vivo validation was performed on two healthy subjects and two prostate cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy. The longitudinal repeatability was quantified using the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) in one of the healthy subjects by repeated scans over 1 year. One prostate cancer patient was scanned at three time points, before initiating therapy and following brachytherapy and external beam radiation. Changes in the T1/T2 maps obtained with the proposed method were quantified. The prostate, peripheral and transitional zones, and visible dominant lesion were delineated for each study, and the statistics and distribution of the quantitative mapping values were analyzed. Significant image quality improvements compared with standard reconstruction methods were obtained with the proposed subspace reconstruction method. A notable decrease in the spread of the T1/T2 values without biasing the estimated mean values was observed with the subspace reconstruction and agreed with reported literature values. The subspace reconstruction enabled visualization of small differences in T1/T2 values in the tumor region within the peripheral zone. Longitudinal imaging of a volunteer subject yielded CCC of 0.89 for MRF T1, and 0.81 for MRF T2 in the prostate gland. Longitudinal imaging of the prostate patient confirmed the feasibility of capturing radiation treatment related changes. This work is a proof-of-concept for a high resolution and fast quantitative mapping using golden-angle radial MRF combined with a subspace reconstruction technique for longitudinal treatment response assessment in subjects undergoing radiation treatment.',\n","       'Dual probe difference specimen imaging for prostate cancer margin assessment.SIGNIFICANCE: Positive margin status due to incomplete removal of tumor tissue during radical prostatectomy for high-risk localized prostate cancer requires reoperation or adjuvant therapy, which increases morbidity and mortality. Adverse effects of prostate cancer treatments commonly include erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, and bowel dysfunction, making successful initial curative prostatectomy imperative. AIM: Current intraoperative tumor margin assessment is largely limited to frozen section analysis, which is a lengthy, labor-intensive process that is obtrusive to the clinical workflow within the operating room (OR). Therefore, a rapid method for prostate cancer margin assessment in the OR could improve outcomes for patients. APPROACH: Dual probe difference specimen imaging (DDSI), which uses paired antibody-based probes that are labeled with spectrally distinct fluorophores, was shown herein for prostate cancer margin assessment. The paired antibody-based probes consisted of a targeted probe to prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and an untargeted probe, which were used as a cocktail to stain resected murine tissue specimens including prostate tumor, adipose, muscle, and normal prostate. Ratiometric images (i.e., DDSI) of the difference between targeted and untargeted probe uptake were calculated and evaluated for accuracy using receiver operator characteristic curve analysis with area under the curve values used to evaluate the utility of the DDSI method to detect PSMA positive prostate cancer. RESULTS: Targeted and untargeted probe uptake was similar between the high and low PSMA expressing tumor due to nonspecific probe uptake after topical administration. The ratiometric DDSI approach showed substantial contrast difference between the PSMA positive tumors and their respective normal tissues (prostate, adipose, muscle). Furthermore, DDSI showed substantial contrast difference between the high PSMA expressing tumors and the minimally PSMA expressing tumors due to the ratiometric correction for the nonspecific uptake patterns in resected tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Previous work has shown that ratiometic imaging has strong predictive value for breast cancer margin status using topical administration. Translation of the ratiometric DDSI methodology herein from breast to prostate cancers demonstrates it as a robust, ratiometric technique that provides a molecularly specific imaging modality for intraoperative margin detection. Using the validated DDSI protocol on resected prostate cancers permitted rapid and accurate assessment of PSMA status as a surrogate for prostate cancer margin status. Future studies will further evaluate the utility of this technology to quantitatively characterize prostate margin status using PSMA as a biomarker.',\n","       'Versatile FeMoOv nanozyme bipolar electrode electrochemiluminescence biosensing and imaging platform for detection of H(2)O(2) and PSA.In this work, a unique FeMoOv nanozyme-bipolar electrode (NM-BPE) electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensing and imaging platform was proposed for the first time to realize sensitive detection of target hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and prostate specific antigen (PSA). Considering the advantage that the cathode and anode poles of the bipolar electrode (BPE) can be modified respectively, this work was carried out using anode equipped with ECL reagent bipyridine ruthenium (Ru(bpy)(3)(2+)), and cathode equipped with the Fe-doped molybdenum oxide/Au nanoparticles (FeMoOv/AuNPs) with excellent peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT)-like activity. Because FeMoOv/AuNPs show efficient enzyme catalysis eﬀect and can greatly promote the decomposition of H(2)O(2), thus the electron transfer rate in the NM-BPE system would be much accelerated to enhance the ECL signal of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+). Based on this principle, this work not only realized sensitive detection of H(2)O(2), but also ingeniously designed an sandwich immunosensor using FeMoOv/AuNPs as recognition probe to mediate the ECL response on the anode, achieving highly sensitive detection of PSA. Furthermore, a unique mobile phone ECL imaging system was developed for assay of PSA at different concentrations, which opened a new portable imaging sensing device for bioassays. This work was the first time to combine nanozymes with bipolar electrodes for ECL analysis and imaging, which not only broadened the applications of nanozymes, but also pioneered the new joint ECL research technique of bipolar electrode and ECL imaging in bioassays, showing great application prospect for multiple detection of proteins, nucleic acids and cancer cells.',\n","       'Successful Salvage Brachytherapy after Infusion of Gold AuroShell Nanoshells for Localized Prostate Cancer in a Human Patient.nan',\n","       \"Comparison of quantitative parameters and radiomic features as inputs into machine learning models to predict the Gleason score of prostate cancer lesions.INTRODUCTION: The classification of prostate cancer (PCa) lesions using Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) suffers from poor inter-reader agreement. This study compared quantitative parameters or radiomic features from multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) or positron emission tomography (PET), as inputs into machine learning (ML) to predict the Gleason scores (GS) of detected lesions for improved PCa lesion classification. METHODS: 20 biopsy-confirmed PCa subjects underwent imaging before radical prostatectomy. A pathologist assigned GS from tumour tissue. Two radiologists and one nuclear medicine physician delineated the lesions on the mpMR and PET images, yielding 45 lesion inputs. Seven quantitative parameters were extracted from the lesions, namely T2-weighted (T2w) image intensity, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), transfer constant (K(TRANS)), efflux rate constant (K(ep)), and extracellular volume ratio (V(e)) from mpMR images, and SUV(mean) and SUV(max) from PET images. Eight radiomic features were selected out of 109 radiomic features from T2w, ADC and PET images. Quantitative parameters or radiomic features, with risk factors of age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), PSA density and volume, of 45 different lesion inputs were input in different combinations into four ML models - Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest-Neighbour (kNN), Ensembles model (EM). RESULTS: SUV(max) yielded the highest accuracy in discriminating detected lesions. Among the 4 ML models, kNN yielded the highest accuracies of 0.929 using either quantitative parameters or radiomic features with risk factors as input. CONCLUSIONS: ML models' performance is dependent on the input combinations and risk factors further improve ML classification accuracy.\",\n","       'Dynamics of CXCR4 positive circulating tumor cells in prostate cancer patients during radiotherapy.Ablative radiotherapy is a highly efficient treatment modality for patients with metastatic prostate cancer (PCa). However, a subset of patients does not respond. Currently, this subgroup with bad prognosis cannot be identified before disease progression. We hypothesize that markers indicative of radioresistance, stemness and/or bone tropism may have a prognostic potential to identify patients profiting from metastases-directed radiotherapy. Therefore, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) were analyzed in patients with metastatic PCa (n\\xa0=\\xa024) during radiotherapy with CellSearch, multicolor flow cytometry and imaging cytometry. Analysis of copy-number alteration indicates a polyclonal CTC population that changes after radiotherapy. CTCs were found in 8 out of 24 patients (33.3%) and were associated with a shorter time to biochemical progression after radiotherapy. Whereas the total CTC count dropped after radiotherapy, a chemokine receptor CXCR4-expressing subpopulation representing 28.6% of the total CTC population remained stable up to 3 months. At once, we observed higher chemokine CCL2 plasma concentrations and proinflammatory monocytes. Additional functional analyses demonstrated key roles of CXCR4 and CCL2 for cellular radiosensitivity, tumorigenicity and stem-like potential in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, a high CXCR4 and CCL2 expression was found in bone metastasis biopsies of PCa patients. In summary, panCK(+) CXCR4(+) CTCs may have a prognostic potential in patients with metastatic PCa treated with metastasis-directed radiotherapy.',\n","       'PIM1 phosphorylates ABI2 to enhance actin dynamics and promote tumor invasion.Distinguishing key factors that drive the switch from indolent to invasive disease will make a significant impact on guiding the treatment of prostate cancer (PCa) patients. Here, we identify a novel signaling pathway linking hypoxia and PIM1 kinase to the actin cytoskeleton and cell motility. An unbiased proteomic screen identified Abl-interactor 2 (ABI2), an integral member of the wave regulatory complex (WRC), as a PIM1 substrate. Phosphorylation of ABI2 at Ser183 by PIM1 increased ABI2 protein levels and enhanced WRC formation, resulting in increased protrusive activity and cell motility. Cell protrusion induced by hypoxia and/or PIM1 was dependent on ABI2. In vivo smooth muscle invasion assays showed that overexpression of PIM1 significantly increased the depth of tumor cell invasion, and treatment with PIM inhibitors significantly reduced intramuscular PCa invasion. This research uncovers a HIF-1-independent signaling axis that is critical for hypoxia-induced invasion and establishes a novel role for PIM1 as a key regulator of the actin cytoskeleton.',\n","       'The ethanol extract of Cyperus exaltatus var. iwasakii exhibits cell cycle dysregulation, ERK1/2/p38 MAPK/AKT phosphorylation, and reduced MMP-9-mediated metastatic capacity in prostate cancer models in vitro and in vivo.BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death worldwide in men. The development of novel and highly efficient therapeutic strategies is strongly recommended to treat prostate cancer. Cyperaceae are an ecologically and economically important family of plants with several pharmacological effects. However, the biological efficacy of Cyperus exaltatus var. iwasakii (CE) is unknown. PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the antitumor effect of the ethanol extract of CE against prostate cancer. METHODS: In vitro antitumor efficacy of CE was explored by the MTT assay, cell counting assay, FACS analysis, immunoblot, wound-healing migration, invasion assay, zymographic assay, and EMSA in prostate cancer cells, DU145 and LNCaP. For in vivo experiments, xenograft mice were injected with LNCaP cells. Histology (H&E and Ki-67) and biochemical enzyme assay were then performed. The toxicity test was evaluated by an acute toxicity assay. The phytochemical constituents of CE were identified by spectrometric and chromatographic analyses. RESULTS: CE exerted a significant antiproliferative effect against prostate cancer cells. CE-induced antiproliferative cells were associated with cell cycle arrest at G(0)/G(1) (cyclin D1/CDK4, cyclin E/CDK2, p21(Waf1)) in DU145 cells, but G(2)/M (ATR, CHK1, Cdc2, Cdc25c, p21(Waf1), and p53) in LNCaP cells. CE stimulated the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and AKT in DU145 cells, but only p38 MAPK phosphorylation was increased in LNCaP cells. CE treatment suppressed migration and invasion in the two types of prostate cancer cells by inhibiting MMP-9 activity through the regulation of transcription factors, such as AP-1 and NF-κB. In vivo experiments showed a reduction in tumor weight and size following oral CE administration. Histochemistry confirmed that CE inhibited tumor growth in the mouse LNCaP xenograft model. The administration of CE had no adverse effects on body weight, behavioral patterns, blood biochemistry, and histopathology findings of vital organs in mice. Finally, a total of 13 phytochemical constituents were identified and quantified in CE. The most abundant secondary metabolites in CE were astragalin, tricin, and p-coumaric acid. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated the antitumor efficacy of CE against prostate cancer. These findings suggest that CE might be a potential candidate for prostate cancer prevention or treatment.',\n","       'Rational design, synthesis and biological evaluation of benzo[d]isoxazole derivatives as potent BET bivalent inhibitors for potential treatment of prostate cancer.Multivalency is an attractive strategy for effective binding to target protein. Bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family features two tandem bromodomains (BD1, BD2), which are considered to be potential new targets for prostate cancer. Herein, we report the rational design, optimization, and evaluation of a class of novel BET bivalent inhibitors based on our monovalent BET inhibitor 7 (Y06037). The representative bivalent inhibitor 17b effectively inhibited the cell growth of LNCaP, exhibiting 32 folds more potency than monovalent inhibitor 7. Besides, 17b induced 95.1\\xa0% PSA regression in LNCaP cell at 2\\xa0μM. Docking study was further carried out to reveal the potential binding mode of 17b with two BET bromodomains. Our study demonstrates that 17b (Y13021) is a promising BET bivalent inhibitor for the treatment of prostate cancer.',\n","       'A case of metastatic adenoid cystic (basal cell) carcinoma of the prostate: Systemic therapy for a rare disease.BACKGROUND: Metastatic adenoid cystic (basal cell) carcinoma of the prostate is an exceedingly rare disease entity. As a result, no current consensus exists for optimal systemic therapy. METHODS: We present a patient with metastatic adenoid cystic (basal cell) carcinoma of the prostate who subsequently received systemic treatment, including chemotherapy and immunotherapy. We comprehensively reviewed all published data on therapy outcomes in advanced disease. RESULTS: Our patient benefited from combination chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel), with objective radiographic response and reduction in cancer-related pain. However, chemotherapy was stopped due to cumulative neurotoxicity, and subsequent immunotherapy with atezolizumab did not produce any response. Our literature review revealed inconsistent outcomes with various treatments but showed most promise with chemotherapy. Targeted therapy and immunotherapy seem to benefit specific cases, and androgen deprivation therapy had minimal evidence of benefit. CONCLUSION: Based on the findings of our case report and literature review, we suggest platinum-based chemotherapy doublets as first-line treatment for metastatic cases of adenoid cystic (basal cell) carcinoma of the prostate, reserving targeted therapy or immunotherapy for select cases based upon molecular profiles.',\n","       'Male Reproduction and Aging.Recent publications of well-conducted population studies have informed us that the syndromic prevalence of age-related low testosterone, also known as late-onset hypogonadism, is quite low. Several well-conducted trials in middle-aged and older men with age-related decline in testosterone levels have revealed that efficacy of testosterone therapy is modest with improvement in sexual function, mood, volumetric bone density, and anemia. Although select older men might benefit from testosterone therapy, its effect on prostate cancer risk and major adverse cardiovascular events remains unclear. The results of the ongoing TRAVERSE trial will likely provide important insights into these risks.',\n","       'Significance of extraprostatic extension by Grade Groups 1-3 prostatic carcinoma on needle biopsy.BACKGROUND: It is rare for extraprostatic extension (EPE) on biopsy to be seen with Grade Groups (GG) 1-3 (Gleason scores 3\\u2009+\\u20093\\u2009=\\u20096; 3\\u2009+\\u20094\\u2009=\\u20097; 4\\u2009+\\u20093\\u2009=\\u20097) prostatic adenocarcinoma, and there is no data whether this finding should be a contraindication for performing radical prostatectomy (RP). METHODS: Thirty eight cases with GG 1-3 prostatic adenocarcinoma as the highest grade in the case with EPE on biopsy were identified from our consultation files. Highly unfavorable findings at RP were those that if they could have been predicted preoperatively, might have factored into the decision of whether to proceed with surgery. For these purposes, highly unfavorable pathology at RP was defined as either the presence of seminal vesicle invasion or lymph node metastases or GG5 (Gleason score 9-10). RESULTS: Among 37 patients with clinical follow-up data, 18 (49%) received radiation and/or hormonal therapy (RT/HT), 13 patients (35%) either underwent (n\\u2009=\\u200911) or are planning (n\\u2009=\\u20092) RP, and 6 patients (16%) received either ablation therapy or active surveillance. Based on the 11 RP pathology reports, 8 were GG2, one GG3 with tertiary pattern 5, and two GG3. Ten cases were reported to have EPE and six cases had positive margins. Only one had highly unfavorable pathology with pT3bN1 disease. The only difference between the RP and the RT/HT groups in their pretreatment parameters was the mean age of the RP patients was 61 compared with 69 for the RT/HT men (p\\u2009=\\u20090.02); the lack of many cases with highly unfavorable pathology at RP cannot be attributable to a selection bias of men with lower volume cancer on biopsy or lower serum prostate-specific antigen levels choosing RP over RT/HT. CONCLUSIONS: Despite EPE on biopsy, most men do not have highly unfavorable pathology at RP, and this treatment should remain an option in this setting.',\n","       'Erratum to \"Fractionated stereotactic body radiotherapy for up to five prostate cancer oligometastases: Interim outcomes of a prospective clinical trial\".nan',\n","       \"Adverse metabolic consequences of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) on Asian patients with prostate cancer: Primary results from the real-life experience of ADT in Asia (READT) study.BACKGROUND: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) use in prostate cancer (PCa) has seen a rising trend. We investigated the relationship between ADT and adverse changes in metabolic parameters in an Asian population. METHODS: This is an international prospective multicenter single-arm cohort yielded from the real-life experience of ADT in Asia\\xa0(READT) registry. Consecutive ADT-naïve patients diagnosed of PCa and started on ADT were prospectively recruited from 2016 and analyzed. Baseline patient characteristics, PCa disease status, and metabolic parameters were documented. Patients were followed up at 6-month interval for up to 5 years. Metabolic parameters including body weight, lipid profiles, and glycemic profiles were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: 589 patients were eligible for analysis. ADT was associated with adverse glycemic profiles, being notable at 6 months upon ADT initiation and persisted beyond 1 year. Comparing to baseline, fasting glucose level and hemoglobin A1c level increased by 4.8% (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001) and 2.7% (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001), respectively. Triglycerides level was also elevated by 16.1% at 6th month and by 20.6% at 12th month compared to baseline (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Mean body weight was 1.09\\u2009kg above baseline at 18th month (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). CONCLUSION: ADT was associated with adverse metabolic parameters in terms of glycemic profiles, lipid profiles, and body weight in the Asian population. These changes developed early in the treatment and can persist beyond the first year. Regular monitoring of the biochemical profiles during treatment is paramount in safeguarding the patients' metabolic health.\",\n","       'Efficacy of zoledronic acid for the elimination of disseminated tumor cells in a clinically relevant, spontaneously metastatic prostate cancer xenograft model.Bone metastases develop in >90\\xa0% of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (PCa) through complex interactions between the bone microenvironment and tumor cells. Previous androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), which is known to cause bone loss, as well as anti-resorptive agents such as zoledronic acid (ZA), used to prevent skeletal complications, may influence these interactions and thereby the growth of disseminated tumor cells (DTC) in the bone marrow (BM). Here, a spontaneously metastatic xenograft tumor model of human PCa was further optimized to mimic the common clinical situation of ADT (castration) combined with primary tumor resection in vivo. The effects of these interventions, alone or in combination with ZA treatment, on tumor cell dissemination to the BM and other distant sites were analyzed. Metastatic burden was quantified by human-specific Alu-qPCR, bioluminescence imaging (BLI), and immunohistochemistry. Further, bone remodeling was assessed by static histomorphometry and serum parameters. Initial comparative analysis between NSG and SCID mice showed that spontaneous systemic dissemination of subcutaneous PC-3 xenograft tumors was considerably enhanced in NSG mice. Primary tumor resection and thereby prolonged observational periods resulted in a higher overall metastatic cell load at necropsy and tumor growth alone caused significant bone loss, which was further augmented by surgical castration. In addition, castrated mice showed a strong trend towards higher bone metastasis loads. Weekly treatment of mice with ZA completely prevented castration- and tumor-induced bone loss but had no effect on bone metastasis burden. Conversely, the total lung metastasis load as determined by BLI was significantly decreased upon ZA treatment. These findings provide a basis for future research on the role of ZA not only in preventing skeletal complications but also in reducing metastasis to other organs.',\n","       \"Prognostic factors of overall and prostate-specific antigen-progression-free survival in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with (177) Lu-PSMA-617. A single-center prospective observational study.BACKGROUND: Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is characterized by heterogeneity among patients as well as therapy responses due to diverse genetic, epigenetic differences, and resistance mechanisms. At this stage of the disease, therapy modalities should be individualized in light of the patients' clinical state, symptoms, and genetic characteristics. In this prospective study, we aimed to evaluate the outcome of patients with mCRPC treated with (177) Lutetium labeled PSMA-617 therapy (PSMA-RLT), as well as baseline and therapy-related parameters associated with survival. METHODS: This prospective study included 52 patients who received two to six cycles of PSMA-RLT. Primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-progression-free survival (PFS). (18) F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and (68) Ga-PSMA (PSMA) Positron Emission Tomography/Computer Tomography (PET/CT) scans were performed for a comprehensive assessment of tumor burden and heterogeneity. Biochemical, imaging, clinical, and therapy-related parameters were analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier, log-rank, and Cox regression analyses to predict OS and PFS. RESULTS: Median OS and PSA-PFS were 17.7 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 15.2-20.2) and 6.6 months (95% CI: 4.5-8.8), respectively. Primary resistance to PSMA-RLT (hazard ratio [HR]: 12.57, 95% CI: 2.4-65.2, p: 0.003), <30% PSA response rate after first cycle of PSMA-RLT (HR: 1.016, 95% CI: 1.006-1.03, p: 0.003), FDG\\u2009>\\u2009PSMA disease (HR: 4.9, 95% CI: 1.19-20.62, p: 0.03), PSA doubling time (PSA DT) of ≤2.4 months (HR: 15.7, 95% CI: 3.7-66.4, p: <0.0001), and low hemoglobin levels (HR: 0.59, 95%\\xa0CI: 0.41-0.83, p: 0.003) were correlated with poor OS in the multivariate analysis. Bone scintigraphy\\u2009> PSMA\\xa0disease (HR: 5.6; 95%\\xa0CI: 1.8-17, p: 0.002) and high C-reactive protein (HR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1-1.7, p: 0.001) were significant predictive biomarkers for PFS in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: PSA response rate and pattern to PSMA-RLT are the most important predictors of survival in patients receiving PSMA-RLT. Being a strong predictive biomarker, combined FDG and PSMA PET can be helpful for the decision of PSMA-RLT eligibility.\",\n","       'Salvage stereotactic reirradiation for intraprostatic cancer recurrence: A large retrospective study.INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. Thirty to forty-seven percent of patients treated with exclusive radiotherapy for prostate cancer will experience intraprostate recurrence. The use of radiotherapy in stereotactic conditions allows millimetric accuracy in irradiation to the target zone that minimizes the dose to organs at risk. In this study, we evaluated the clinical outcome of prostatic reirradiation with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in patients with intraprostatic recurrence initially treated by radiotherapy. METHOD: This single-center retrospective study included 41 patients diagnosed with exclusive local recurrence of prostate cancer after radiotherapy and treatedby stereotactic Cyberknife irradiation. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and the safety of stereotactic reirradiation for patients with intraprostatic recurrence initially treated with radiotherapy. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 35 months. The 2-year biochemical relapse-free survival was 72.89%, the 2-year local recurrence free survival was 93.59%, the 2-year local regional recurrence-free survival was 85.24%, and the 2-year metastasis-free survival was to 91.49%. The analysis of toxicities showed a good tolerance of stereotactic irradiation. Urinary and gastro-intestinal adverse events was mostly of grades 1-2 (CTCAEv4). Grade 3 toxicity occurred in one to two patients. CONCLUSION: Stereotactic reirradiation appears effective and well-tolerated for local recurrence of prostate cancer and might allow to delay the introduction of hormonal therapy and its side effects.',\n","       'Patient-reported functional outcomes and oncological control after primary focal cryotherapy for clinically significant prostate cancer: A Phase II mandatory biopsy-monitored study.INTRODUCTION: We report herein the impact of focal therapy (FT) on multi-domain functional outcomes in a Phase II prospective clinical trial (NCT04138914) in focal cryotherapy for clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). METHODS: The primary outcome was the detection of a ≥5 point deterioration in any of the four main expanded prostate index composite (EPIC) functional domains. Pretreatment multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and transperineal targeted and systematic saturation biopsy were used to select patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA)≤20\\u2009ng/mL, Gleason grade group (GG) ≤4, mpMRI lesion volume\\u2009≤\\u20093\\u2009mL (for a single lesion) or ≤1.5\\u2009mL (where two lesions were present). Focal cryotherapy was performed with a minimum 5\\u2009mm margin around each target lesion. EPIC scores were obtained at baseline and posttreatment at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Mandatory repeat mpMRI and prostate biopsy were performed at 12 months to determine the infield and outfield recurrence. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were recruited. The mean age was 68 years, with PSA of 7.3\\u2009ng/mL and PSA density of 0.19\\u2009ng/mL(2) . No Clavien-Dindo ≥3 complications occurred. Transient worsening of EPIC urinary (mean diff 16.0, p\\u2009<\\u20090.001, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.8-23.6) and sexual function scores (mean diff 11.0, p:0.005, 95% CI: 4.0-17.7) were observed at 1-month posttreatment, with recovery by Month 3. A subgroup who had ablation extending to the neurovascular bundle had a trend to delayed recovery of sexual function to Month 6. At 12-month repeat mpMRI and biopsy, 22 patients (78.6%) had no detectable csPCa. Of the six patients (21.4%) who had csPCa recurrences, four were GG2, one GG3, and one GG4. Four patients underwent repeat FT, one underwent radical prostatectomy, while the remaining one patient with low-volume GG2 cancer opted for active surveillance. CONCLUSION: FT using cryotherapy was associated with a transient deterioration of urinary and sexual function with resolution at 3 months posttreatment and with reasonable early efficacy in well-selected csPCa patients.',\n","       'The role of multiparametric magnetic resonance in active surveillance of a low-risk prostate cancer cohort from clinical practice.INTRODUCTION: Active surveillance (AS) is considered a suitable management practice for those patients with low-risk prostate cancer (PCa). At present, however, the role of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) in AS protocols has not yet been clearly established. OUTCOMES: To determine the role of mpMRI and its ability to detect significant prostate cancer (SigPCa) in PCa patients enrolled in AS protocols. MATERIALS AND METHODS: There were 229 patients enrolled in an AS protocol between 2011 and 2020 at Reina Sofía University Hospital. MRI interpretation was based on PIRADS v.1 or v.2/2.1 classification. Demographics, clinical, and analytical data were collected and analyzed. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated for mpMRI in different scenarios. We defined SigPCa and reclassification/progression as a Gleason score (GS)\\u2009≥\\u20093\\u2009+\\u20094, a clinical stage ≥T2b, or an increase in PCa volume. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests were used to estimate progression-free survival time. RESULTS: Median age was 69.02 (±7.73) at diagnosis, with a 0.15 (±0.08) PSA density (PSAD). Eighty-six patients were reclassified after confirmatory biopsy, with a suspicious mpMRI an indication for a clear reclassification and risk-predictor factor in disease progression (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). During follow-up, 46 patients were changed from AS to active treatment mainly due to disease progression. Ninety patients underwent ≥2mpMRI during follow-up, with a median follow-up of 29 (15-49) months. Thirty-four patients had a baseline suspicious mpMRI (at diagnostic or confirmatory biopsy): 14 patients with a PIRADS 3 and 20 patients with ≥PIRADS 4. From 14 patients with a PIRADS 3 baseline mpMRI, 29% progressed radiologically, with a 50% progression rate versus 10% (1/10 patients) for those with similar or decreased mpMRI risk. Of the 56 patients with a non-suspicious baseline mpMRI (PIRADS\\u2009<\\u20092), 14 patients (25%) had an increased degree of radiological suspicion, with a detection rate of SigPCa of 29%. The mpMRI NPV during follow-up was 0.91. CONCLUSION: A suspicious mpMRI increases the reclassification and disease progression risk during follow-up and plays an important role in monitoring biopsies. In addition, a high NPV at mpMRI follow-up can help to decrease the need to monitor biopsies during AS.',\n","       'Obesity and main urologic cancers: Current systematic evidence, novel biological mechanisms, perspectives and challenges.Urologic cancers (UC) account for 13.1% of all new cancer cases and 7.9% of all cancer-related deaths. A growing body of evidence has indicated a potential causal link between obesity and UC. The aim of the present review is to appraise in a critical and integrative manner evidence from meta-analyses and mechanistic studies on the role of obesity in four prevalent UC (kidney-KC, prostate-PC, urinary bladder-UBC, and testicular cancer-TC). Special emphasis is given on Mendelian Randomization Studies (MRS) corroborating a genetic causal association between obesity and UC, as well as on the role of classical and novel adipocytokines. Furthermore, the molecular pathways that link obesity to the development and progression of these cancers are reviewed. Available evidence indicates that obesity confers increased risk for KC, UBC, and advanced PC (20-82%, 10-19%, and 6-14%, respectively), whereas for TC adult height (5-cm increase) may increase the risk by 13%. Obese females tend to be more susceptible to UBC and KC than obese males. MRS have shown that a higher genetic-predicted BMI may be causally linked to KC and UBC but not PC and TC. Biological mechanisms that are involved in the association between excess body weight and UC include the Insulin-like Growth Factor axis, altered availability of sex hormones, chronic inflammation and oxidative stress, abnormal secretion of adipocytokines, ectopic fat deposition, dysbiosis of the gastrointestinal and urinary tract microbiomes and circadian rhythm dysregulation. Anti-hyperglycemic and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, statins, and adipokine receptor agonists/antagonists show potential as adjuvant cancer therapies. Identifying obesity as a modifiable risk factor for UC may have significant public health implications, allowing clinicians to tailor individualized prevention strategies for patients with excess body weight.',\n","       '\"Time\" for obesity-related cancer: The role of the circadian rhythm in cancer pathogenesis and treatment.The circadian rhythm is regulated by an intrinsic time-tracking system, composed both of a central and a peripheral clock, which influences the cycles of activities and sleep of an individual over 24\\xa0h. At the molecular level, the circadian rhythm begins when two basic helix-loop-helix/Per-ARNT-SIM (bHLH-PAS) proteins, BMAL-1 and CLOCK, interact with each other to produce BMAL-1/CLOCK heterodimers in the cytoplasm. The BMAL-1/CLOCK target genes encode for the repressor components of the clock, cryptochrome (Cry1 and Cry2) and the Period proteins (Per1, Per2 and Per3). It has been recently demonstrated that the disruption of circadian rhythm is associated with an increased risk of developing obesity and obesity-related diseases. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the disruption of the circadian rhythm plays a key role in tumorigenesis. Further, an association between the circadian rhythm disruptions and an increased incidence and progression of several types of cancer (e.g., breast, prostate, colorectal and thyroid cancer) has been found. As the perturbation of circadian rhythm has adverse metabolic consequences (e.g., obesity) and at the same time tumor promoter functions, this manuscript has the aim to report how the aberrant circadian rhythms affect the development and prognosis of different types of obesity-related cancers (breast, prostate, colon rectal and thyroid cancer) focusing on both human studies and on molecular aspects.',\n","       \"A prospective study of the relationship between CRPC patient's quality of life after enzalutamide and serum testosterone levels measured via LC-MS/MS.BACKGROUND: Enzalutamide (ENZ) is used in the treatment of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). The quality of life (QoL) of CRPC patients during ENZ treatment is very important, but predictive markers of QoL have not been identified. We investigated the relationship between the serum testosterone (T) level before ENZ treatment and QoL changes in CRPC patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective study was conducted between 2014 and 2018 at Gunma University Hospital and related facilities. We analyzed 95 patients in whom QoL could be evaluated using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) questionnaire at baseline, and after 4 and 12 weeks of ENZ treatment. Serum T levels were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). RESULTS: The study population of 95 patients had a median age of 72 years and median prostate-specific antigen level of 21.6\\u2009ng/mL. The median overall survival from the commencement of ENZ treatment was 26.8 months. The median serum T level before ENZ treatment was 50.0\\u2009pg/mL. The mean total FACT-P scores at baseline, and after 4 and 12 weeks of ENZ treatment, were 95.8, 91.7, and 90.1, respectively. Differences in FACT-P scores between the high T level (High-T) group and low T level (Low-T) group (distinguished based on median split of the T level) were examined. The mean FACT-P scores were significantly higher in the High-T than Low-T group after both 4 and 12 weeks of ENZ treatment (98.5 vs. 84.6 and 96.4 vs. 82.2, respectively, both p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The mean FACT-P score was significantly lower in the Low-T group after 12 weeks than before ENZ treatment (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). CONCLUSION: The serum T level before treatment may be useful for predicting QoL changes after ENZ treatment in CRPC patients.\",\n","       'Postoperative functional and cancer control evaluation of conventional and Retzius-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: Comparison of selected cases by propensity score matching.AIM: Although many reports have shown that Retzius-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RS-RARP) is effective for postoperative urinary continence, the postoperative voiding status and sexual function associated with this technique have not yet been adequately compared with those associated with conventional RARP (C-RARP). In this study, the lower urinary tract function, erectile function, and cancer control after C-RARP and RS-RARP were compared chronologically. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We selected 50 cases of C-RARP and RS-RARP each by propensity score matching and evaluated them over time using various questionnaires. Urinary continence recovery rates and biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared between the two groups using the log-rank test. RESULTS: When urinary continence was defined as 0 pads per day, 0 pads per day\\u2009+\\u20091 security linear, or ≤1 pad per day, the postoperative improvement in urinary continence was better with RS-RARP over the course of up to 1 year for all definitions. The International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form total scores and the Overactive Bladder Symptom Scores were better in the postoperative RS-RARP group. There were no significant differences in the International Prostate Symptom Score total score, QOL score, and erectile hardness score between the two groups during the observation period. The BCR-free survival did not differ significantly between the two groups CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative urinary continence was better in the RS-RARP group than in the C-RARP group; however, the voiding function, erectile function, and cancer control did not differ significantly.',\n","       'Age-related differences in cancer relative survival in the United States: A SEER-18 analysis.Cancer survival has improved since the 1990s, but to different extents across age groups, with a disadvantage for older adults.

We used data from 18 United States Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results cancer registries and included cancers diagnosed in 2012 to 2016 followed until December 31, 2017. We estimated absolute differences in RS between the 50 to 64 age group and the 75 to 84 age group. The smallest differences were observed for prostate and breast cancers (1.8%-points [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.5-2.1] and 1.9%-points [95% CI: 1.5-2.3], respectively). The largest was for ovarian cancer (27%-points, 95% CI: 24-29). For other cancers, differences ranged between 7 (95% CI: 5-9, esophagus) and 18%-points (95% CI: 17-19, pancreas). Except for pancreatic cancer, cancer type and stage combinations with very high (>95%) or very low (<40%) 1-year RS tended to have smaller age-related differences in survival than those with mid-range prognoses. Age-related differences in 1-year survival conditioning on having survived 1-year were small for most cancer and stage combinations. The broad variation in survival differences by age across cancer types and stages, especially in the first year, age-related differences in survival are likely influenced by amenability to treatment. Future work to measure the extent of age-related differences that are avoidable, and identify how to narrow the survival gap, may have most benefit by prioritizing cancers with relatively large age-related differences in survival (eg, stomach, esophagus, liver and pancreas).',\n","       'Prostate lesion segmentation based on a 3D end-to-end convolution neural network with deep multi-scale attention.Prostate cancer is one of the deadest cancers among human beings. To better diagnose the prostate cancer, prostate lesion segmentation becomes a very important work, but its progress is very slow due to the prostate lesions small in size, irregular in shape, and blurred in contour. Therefore, automatic prostate lesion segmentation from mp-MRI is a great significant work and a challenging task. However, the most existing multi-step segmentation methods based on voxel-level classification are time-consuming, may introduce errors in different steps and lead to error accumulation. To decrease the computation time, harness richer 3D spatial features, and fuse the multi-level contextual information of mp-MRI, we present an automatic segmentation method in which all steps are optimized conjointly as one step to form our end-to-end convolutional neural network. The proposed end-to-end network DMSA-V-Net consists of two parts: (1) a 3D V-Net is used as the backbone network, it is the first attempt in employing 3D convolutional neural network for CS prostate lesion segmentation, (2) a deep multi-scale attention mechanism is introduced into the 3D V-Net which can highly focus on the ROI while suppressing the redundant background. As a merit, the attention can adaptively re-align the context information between the feature maps at different scales and the saliency maps in high-levels. We performed experiments based on five cross-fold validation with data including 97 patients. The results show that the Dice and sensitivity are 0.7014 and 0.8652 respectively, which demonstrates that our segmentation approach is more significant and accurate compared to other methods.',\n","       'Prostate cancer lesion detection, volume quantification and high-grade cancer differentiation using cancer risk maps derived from multiparametric MRI with histopathology as the reference standard.Multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) has proven itself a clinically useful tool to assess prostate cancer (PCa). Our objective was to generate PCa risk maps to quantify the volume and location of both all PCa and high grade (Gleason grade group ≥ 3) PCa. Such capabilities would aid physicians and patients in treatment decisions, targeting biopsy, and planning focal therapy. A cohort of men with biopsy proven prostate cancer and pre-prostatectomy mpMRI were studied. PCa and benign ROIs (1524) were identified on mpMRI and histopathology with histopathology serving as the reference standard. Logistic regression models were created to differentiate PCa from benign tissues. The MRI images were registered to ensure correct overlay. The cancer models were applied to each image voxel within prostates to create probability maps of cancer and of high-grade cancer. Use of an optimum probability threshold quantified PCa volume for all lesions >0.1\\xa0cc. Accuracies were calculated using area under the curve (AUC) for the receiver operating characteristic (ROC). The PCa models utilized apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), T2 weighted (T2W), dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE MRI) enhancement slope, and DCE MRI washout as the statistically significant MRI scans. Application of the PCa maps method provided total PCa volume and individual lesion volumes. The AUCs derived from lesion analysis were 0.91 for all PCa and 0.73 for high-grade PCa. At the optimum threshold, the PCa maps detected 135 / 150 (90%) histopathological lesions >0.1\\xa0cc. This study showed the feasibility of cancer risk maps, created from pre-prostatectomy, mpMR images validated with histopathology, to detect PCa lesions >0.1\\xa0cc. The method quantified the volume of cancer within the prostate. Method improvements were identified by determining root causes for over and underestimation of cancer volumes. The maps have the potential for improved non-invasive capability in quantitative detection, localization, volume estimation, and MRI characterization of PCa.',\n","       'Diagnostic role of plasma ORM2 in differentiating prostate cancer from benign prostatic hyperplasia.PURPOSE: Markers are needed to increase the diagnostic accuracy of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in prostate cancer (PCa) screening. Mounting evidence has shown that plasma proteins can be hopeful biomarkers for cancer diagnosis. METHODS: Tandem mass tag (TMT)-based proteomics and parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) analysis were used to screen the differential proteins and further validated in other independent studies (n\\u2009=\\u2009539). Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC), decision curves and nomograms were applied to assess the diagnostic accuracy of biomarkers. RESULTS: Three candidate proteins (DBP, LCAT and ORM2) were preliminarily screened. Subsequent validation studies revealed significant upregulation of ORM2 in PCa patients across other independent cohorts. ORM2 yielded excellent discriminative power for PCa from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients (AUC\\u2009=\\u20090.861 and 0.814 in validation phases 2a and 2b, respectively). Importantly, the combination of ORM2 and PSA gave better predictive accuracy than PSA alone. We incorporated age, PSA and ORM2 into a nomogram, which yielded C-index of 0.883 in validation phase 2a. A similar C-index of 0.879 was obtained in external validation phase 2b. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our study suggests that ORM2 could be treated as a complementary biomarker for PSA in distinguishing PCa from BPH.',\n","       'BDNF and its signaling in cancer.PURPOSE: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) belongs to the family of neurotrophic factors that can potentially\\xa0increase cancer cell growth, survival, proliferation, anoikis, and migration by tyrosine kinase receptors TrkB and the\\xa0p75NTR death receptor. The activation of BDNF/TrkB pathways leads to several downstream signaling pathways,\\xa0including PI3K/Akt, Jak/STAT, PLCγ, Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK, NF-kB, and transactivation of EGFR. The current review\\xa0aimed to provide an overview of the role of BDNF and its signaling in cancer. METHODS: We searched a major\\xa0medical database, PubMed, to identify eligible studies for a narrative synthesis. RESULTS: Pathological examinations\\xa0demonstrate BDNF overexpression in human cancer, notably involving the prostate, lung, breast, and underlying\\xa0tissues, associated with a higher death rate and poor prognosis. Therefore, measurement of BDNF, either for\\xa0identifying the disease or predicting response to therapy, can be helpful in cancer patients. Expression profiling\\xa0studies have recognized the role of microRNAs (miR) in modulating BDNF/TrkB pathways, such as miR-101, miR-107, miR-134, miR-147, miR-191, miR-200a/c, miR-204, miR-206, miR-210, miR-214, miR-382, miR-496, miR-497, miR-744, and miR-10a-5p, providing a potential biological mechanism by which targeted therapies may correlate\\xa0with decreased BDNF expression in cancers. Clinical studies investigating the use of agents targeting BDNF\\xa0receptors and related signaling pathways and interfering with the related oncogenic effect, including Entrectinib,\\xa0Larotrectinib, Cabozantinib, Repotrectinib, Lestaurtinib, and Selitrectinib, are in progress. CONCLUSION: The aberrant\\xa0signaling of BDNF is implicated in various cancers. Well-designed clinical trials are needed to clarify the BDNF role\\xa0in cancer progression and target it as a therapeutic method.',\n","       \"Whole-exome sequencing of Indian prostate cancer reveals a novel therapeutic target: POLQ.PURPOSE: Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer diagnosed worldwide and the third most common cancer among men in India. This study's objective was to characterise the mutational landscape of Indian prostate cancer using whole-exome sequencing to identify population-specific polymorphisms. METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing was performed of 58 treatment-naive primary prostate tumors of Indian origin. Multiple computational and statistical analyses were used to profile the known common mutations, other deleterious mutations, driver genes, prognostic biomarkers, and gene signatures unique to each clinical parameter. Cox analysis was performed to validate survival-associated genes. McNemar test identified genes significant to recurrence and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted to determine its accuracy. OncodriveCLUSTL algorithm was used to deduce driver genes. The druggable target identified was modeled with its known inhibitor using Autodock. RESULTS: TP53 was the most commonly mutated gene in our cohort. Three novel deleterious variants unique to the Indian prostate cancer subtype were identified: POLQ, FTHL17, and OR8G1. COX regression analysis identified ACSM5, a mitochondrial gene responsible for survival. CYLC1 gene, which encodes for sperm head cytoskeletal protein, was identified as an unfavorable prognostic biomarker indicative of recurrence. The novel POLQ mutant, also identified as a driver gene, was evaluated as the druggable target in this study. POLQ, a DNA repair enzyme implicated in various cancer types, is overexpressed and is associated with a poor prognosis. The mutant POLQ was subjected to structural analysis and modeled with its known inhibitor novobiocin resulting in decreased binding efficiency necessitating the development of a better drug. CONCLUSION: In this pilot study, the molecular profiling using multiple computational and statistical analyses revealed distinct polymorphisms in the Indian prostate cancer cohort. The mutational signatures identified provide a valuable resource for prognostic stratification and targeted treatment strategies for Indian prostate cancer patients. The DNA repair enzyme, POLQ, was identified as the druggable target in this study.\",\n","       'HPLC fluorescence assay for measuring the activity of NAPE-PLD and the action of inhibitors affecting this enzyme.N-Acyl phosphatidylethanolamine-hydrolyzing phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD) is the major enzyme for the biosynthesis of the endocannabinoid anandamide. The role of NAPE-PLD in various physiological and pathophysiological conditions is currently under investigation. For example, the enzyme might be involved in the control of neuronal activity, embryonic development and pregnancy, and prostate cancer. We synthesized a novel NAPE-PLD substrate with a fluorogenic pyrene substituent at the N-acyl residue as tool compound for studying this enzyme. As shown by HPLC with fluorescence detection, in rat brain microsomes the substrate was transformed into the expected pyrene-labeled N-acylethanolamine (NAE), but minor amounts of three by-products could also be detected. In the presence of pan-serine hydrolase and secretory phospholipase A(2) inhibitors, the generation of these compounds, whose identity was verified using reference substances, was abolished. Based on these results, a method for determining the activity of NAPE-PLD was developed, validated, and applied to evaluate the action of known inhibitors of this enzyme. With human sperm, it was shown that the fluorescent substrate can also be used to study NAPE metabolism in intact cells.',\n","       'The association between dairy products consumption and prostate cancer risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis.In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis to estimate the relationship between the consumption of dairy products and the risk of prostate cancer. We searched PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases for relevant articles and identified a total of thirty-three cohort studies between 1989 and 2020. The qualities of included studies were assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Pooled adjusted relative risks (RR) with 95 % CI were calculated. We performed subgroup analyses stratified by dairy type, prostate cancer type, follow-up years, treatment era, collection times, adjustment for confounders and geographic location. In the subgroup analysis stratified by prostate cancer type, the pooled RR were 0·98 (95 % CI 0·94, 1·03) in the advanced group, 1·10 (95 % CI 0·98, 1·24) in the non-advanced group and 0·92 (95 % CI 0·84, 1·00) in the fatal group. In the dose-response analysis, a positive association for the risk of prostate cancer was observed for total dairy products 400 g/d (RR: 1·02; 95 % CI 1·00, 1·03), total milk 200 g/d (RR: 1·02; 95 % CI 1·01, 1·03), cheese 40 g/d (RR: 1·01; 95 % CI 1·00, 1·03) and butter 50 g/d (RR: 1·03; 95 % CI 1·01, 1·05). A decreased risk was observed for the intake of whole milk 100 g/d (RR: 0·97; 95 % CI 0·96, 0·99). Our meta-analysis suggests that high intakes of dairy products may be associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer; however, since many of the studies were affected by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening bias, additional studies with an adjustment of PSA screening are needed.',\n","       \"Investigation of the regulatory effects of synthesized antisense oligonucleotides on androgen receptor (AR) exon 3 splicing in prostate cancer cells.The Androgen Receptor (AR) gene plays a key role in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Controlling the progression of CRPC by inhibiting AR gene expression is one of the core directions for prostate cancer (Pca) drug development. A 23-amino acids retention, named exon 3a, into the DNA binding domain of the splice variant AR23 has been shown to prevent AR from entering the nucleus and restore the sensitivity of cancer cells to related therapies. In this study, we conducted a preliminary investigation of the splicing modulation of the AR gene in order to develop a splice-switching therapy for Pca by promoting exon 3a inclusion. Using mutagenesis-coupled RT-PCR with AR minigene and over-expression of certain splicing factors, we found that serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins are key factors facilitating the recognition of the 3' splice site of exon 3a (L-3' SS), while the deletion or blocking of the polypyrimidine tract (PPT) region of the original 3' splice site of exon 3 (S-3' SS) could strongly enhance exon 3a splicing without affecting the function of any SR protein. Furthermore, we designed a series of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to screen drug candidates, and ASOs targeting S-3' SS and its PPT region or the exonic region of exon 3 turned out to be most effective in rescuing exon 3a splicing. A dose-response test indicated ASO12 as the lead candidate drug significantly promoting the inclusion of exon 3a to more than 85%. MTT assay confirmed that the cell proliferation was significantly inhibited after ASO treatment. Our results provide the first glance to AR splicing regulation. With several promising therapeutic ASO candidates obtained here, further development of ASO drugs to treat CRPC is strongly encouraged.\",\n","       \"Qingdai Decoction suppresses prostate cancer growth in lethal-stage prostate cancer models.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Contemporary therapy for advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) employs reagents such as enzalutamide and abiraterone acetate targeting the androgen receptor (AR) transcription axis only provide a temporary response and rapidly develop resistance. Additionally, neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is an AR pathway-independent and lethal-stage prostate cancer with no standard therapy. Qingdai Decoction (QDT), a traditional Chinese medicine formula, has various pharmacological activities and was widely used for the treatment of different diseases including prostatitis which may contribute to prostate cancer development. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aims to explore the anti-tumor role and potential mechanism of QDT on prostate cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: CRPC prostate cancer cell models and xenograft mice models were established for research. The effect of TCMs on cancer growth and metastasis were determined by CCK-8, wound-healing assays and the PC3-xenografted mice model. The toxicity of QDT in the major organs was investigated by H&E staining. The compound-target network was analyzed with network pharmacology. The correlation of QDT targets with prostate cancer patient's prognosis was analyzed with multiple prostate cancer patient cohorts. The expression of related proteins and mRNA were detected by western blot and real-time PCR. The gene knockdown was achieved with CRISPR-Cas13 technology. RESULTS: By integrating functional screening, network pharmacology analysis, CRISPR-Cas13 directed RNA targeting, and molecular biology validation in different prostate cancer models and clinical prostate cancer cohorts, we found that Qingdai Decoction (QDT), a Traditional Chinese Medicine, can repress cancer growth in advanced prostate cancer models in vitro and in vivo in an AR independent manner by targeting NOS3, TGFB1, and NCOA2. CONCLUSION: This study not only identified QDT as a novel drug for lethal-stage prostate cancer treatment but also provided an extensive Integrative research paradigm for investigating the roles and mechanisms of TCMs for the treatment of other diseases.\",\n","       'Sympathetic β(2)-adrenergic receptor blockade overcomes docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer.PURPOSE: Due to the limited effective therapies, resistance to docetaxel is ordinarily fatal and remains a critical clinical challenge.β2-adrenergic receptor(β2-AR)can promote the metastasis and invasion of prostate cancer, but the role in chemotherapy-resistant prostate cancer remains unclear. METHODS: By downloading the GEO database in NCBI, the expression of β2-AR in different prostate tissues was analyzed. We constructed docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cell lines by the method of dose-escalation. LC3B-labeled stable cells and shAtg5 knockdown stable cells were constructed by lentivirus infection. The molecular mechanism of β2-AR affecting docetaxel sensitivity through apoptosis and autophage were investigated by flow cytometry, mitochondrial membrane potential and western blot. Then we detected the interaction between autophagy and apoptotic by performing immunoprecipitation assay. RESULTS: We show that restraining the activity of β(2)-AR sensitized the cell response and reduced the resistance to docetaxel. The mechanism involves the regulation of β(2)-AR in the cellular response to docetaxel through apoptosis and autophagy via caspase signaling and Atg5/AMPK/mTOR pathway as well as the effect of β(2)-AR on the crosstalk between apoptosis and autophagy via p38 MAPK and JNK/c-Jun/FOXO3a signaling pathways. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that β(2)-AR inhibitor-induced autophagy and apoptosis contribute to the effectiveness responses to docetaxel in castration-resistant prostate cancer, and in combination with pharmacological agents of β(2)-AR and autophagy inhibitors may provide a potential therapeutic strategy to enhance the limited capacity of docetaxel to control castration-resistant prostate cancer.',\n","       'Association between major discrimination and deficit accumulation in African American cancer survivors: The Detroit Research on Cancer Survivors Study.BACKGROUND: Discrimination can adversely affect health and accelerate aging, but little is known about these relationships in cancer survivors. This study examines associations of discrimination and aging among self-identified African American survivors. METHODS: A population-based sample of 2232 survivors 20-79\\xa0years old at diagnosis were enrolled within 5 years of breast (n\\xa0=\\xa0787), colorectal (n\\xa0=\\xa0227), lung (n\\xa0=\\xa0223), or prostate (n\\xa0=\\xa0995) cancer between 2017 and 2022. Surveys were completed post-active therapy. A deficit accumulation index measured aging-related disease and function (score range, 0-1, where <0.20 is robust, 0.20 to <0.35 is pre-frail, and 0.35+ is frail; 0.06 is a large clinically meaningful difference). The discrimination scale assessed ever experiencing major discrimination and seven types of events (score, 0-7). Linear regression tested the association of discrimination and deficit accumulation, controlling for age, time from diagnosis, cancer type, stage and therapy, and sociodemographic variables. RESULTS: Survivors were an average of 62\\xa0years old (SD, 9.6), 63.2% reported ever experiencing major discrimination, with an average of 2.4 (SD, 1.7) types of discrimination events. Only 24.4% had deficit accumulation scores considered robust (mean score, 0.30 [SD, 0.13]). Among those who reported ever experiencing major discrimination, survivors with four to seven types of discrimination events (vs. 0-1) had a large, clinically meaningful increase in adjusted deficits (0.062, p\\xa0<\\xa0.001) and this pattern was consistent across cancer types. CONCLUSION: African American cancer survivors have high deficit accumulated index scores, and experiences of major discrimination were positively associated with these deficits. Future studies are needed to understand the intersectionality between aging, discrimination, and cancer survivorship among diverse populations.',\n","       \"Shrink polymer based electrochemical sensor for point-of-care detection of prostate-specific antigen.There is a growing but unmet need for point-of-care detection of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in body fluid which may facilitate early diagnosis and therapy of prostate cancer in a cost-effective and user-friendly way. Low sensitivity and narrow detection range limits applications of point-of-care testing in practice. Here, an immunosensor is first presented based on shrink polymer and integrated into a miniaturized electrochemical platform for detecting PSA in clinical samples. The sensing electrode was prepared by sputtering a gold film on shrink polymer, followed by heating to shrink the electrode to a small size with wrinkles from nano-scale to micro-scale. These wrinkles can be directly regulated by the thickness of the gold film with high specific areas for enhancement of antigen-antibody binding (3.9 times). A distinct difference between electrochemical active surface area (EASA) and response to PSA of shrink electrodes was observed and discussed. The electrode was treated with air plasma and modified with self-assembled graphene to further enhance the sensor's sensitivity (10.4 times). The shrink sensor with gold 200\\xa0nm thick integrated into the portable system was validated by a label-free immunoassay for detection of PSA in 20\\xa0μL serum within 35\\xa0mins. It exhibited a limit of detection of 0.38\\xa0fg/mL, the lowest among label-free PSA sensors, and a wide linear response from 10\\xa0fg/mL to 1000\\xa0ng/mL.

In this research work, an eco-friendly method of synthesizing AgNPs from the leaf polysaccharide (PS) of Acalypha indica L. ( A. indica) was carried out. Synthesis of polysaccharide-AgNPs (PS-AgNPs) was indicated by visual detection of colour change from pale yellow to light brown. The PS-AgNPs were characterized with different techniques and further evaluated for biological activities. The Ultra violet-visible (UV-Vis.) spectroscopy expressed a sharp absorption peak at 415\\xa0nm confirmed the synthesis. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis revealed the size range of particles from 14\\xa0nm to 85\\xa0nm. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis detected the presence of various functional groups. The cubic crystalline structure of PS-AgNPs was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the particles were found to be oval to polymorphic shaped through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with sizes from 7.25\\xa0nm to 92.51\\xa0nm. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) determined the presence of silver in PS-AgNPs. The zeta potential was -28.0\\xa0mV, which confirmed the stability and an average particle size of 62.2\\xa0nm was calculated through dynamic light scattering (DLS). Lastly, the thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) showed the PS-AgNPs were resistant to high temperature. The PS-AgNPs exhibited significant free radical scavenging activity with an IC(50) value of 112.91\\xa0μg/ml. They were highly capable of inhibiting the growth of different bacterial and plant fungal pathogens and also active to reduce the cell viability of prostate cancer (PC-3) cell line. The IC(50) value was 101.43\\xa0μg/ml. The flow cytometric apoptosis analysis revealed the percentage of viable, apoptotic and necrotic cells of PC-3\\xa0cell line. According to this evaluation, it can be concluded that these biosynthesized and environmentally friendly PS-AgNPs are helpful to improve therapeutics because of significant antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant, and cytotoxic properties to open up new possibilities for euthenics.',\n","       'Sensitive determination of prostate-specific antigen with graphene quantum dot-based fluorescence aptasensor using few-layer V(2)CT(x) MXene as quencher.A novel fluorescence aptasensor of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was established using few-layer vanadium carbide (FL-V(2)CT(x)) nanosheet as a quencher. First, FL-V(2)CT(x) was prepared by the delamination of multi-layer V(2)CT(x) (ML-V(2)CT(x)) with tetramethylammonium hydroxide. The aptamer-carboxyl graphene quantum dots (CGQDs) probe was prepared by combining the aminated PSA aptamer and CGQDs. Then, the aptamer-CGQDs were absorbed onto the surface of FL-V(2)CT(x) by hydrogen bond interaction, which led to the decrease in fluorescence of aptamer-CGQDs due to photoinduced energy transfer. After addition of PSA, PSA-aptamer-CGQDs complex was released from FL-V(2)CT(x). The fluorescence intensity of aptamer-CGQDs-FL-V(2)CT(x) with PSA was higher than that without PSA. The FL-V(2)CT(x)-based fluorescence aptasensor provided a PSA detection linear range from 0.1 to 20\\xa0ng\\xa0mL(-1) with detection limit of 0.03\\xa0ng\\xa0mL(-1). The ΔF value of fluorescence intensities for aptamer-CGQDs-FL-V(2)CT(x) with and without PSA was 5.6, 3.7, 7.7, and 5.4 times of ML-V(2)CT(x), few-layer titanium carbide (FL-Ti(3)C(2)T(x)), ML-Ti(3)C(2)T(x) and graphene oxide aptasensors, respectively, indicating the advantage of FL-V(2)CT(x). The aptasensor had high selectivity for PSA detection compared with some proteins and tumor markers. This proposed method had convenience and high sensitivity for PSA determination. The determination results of PSA in human serum samples using the aptasensor were consistent with those by chemiluminescent immunoanalysis. The fluorescence aptasensor can be successfully applied for PSA determination in serum samples of prostate cancer patients.',\n","       'New autonomous and self-signaling biosensing device for sarcosine detection.An early diagnosis is the gold standard for cancer survival. Biosensors have proven their effectiveness in monitoring cancer biomarkers but are still limited to a series of requirements. This work proposes an integrated power solution, with an autonomous and self-signaling biosensing device. The biorecognition element is produced in situ by molecular imprinting to detect sarcosine, a known biomarker for prostate cancer. The biosensor was assembled on the counter-electrode of a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), simultaneously using EDOT and Pyrrole as monomers for the biomimetic process and the catalytic reduction of triiodide in the DSSC. After the rebinding assays, the hybrid DSSC/biosensor displayed a linear behavior when plotting the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and the charge transfer resistance (R(CT)) against the logarithm of the concentration of sarcosine. The latter obtained a sensitivity of 0.468\\xa0Ω/decade of sarcosine concentration, with a linear range between 1 ng/mL and 10 μg/mL, and a limit of detection of 0.32 ng/mL. When interfacing an electrochromic cell, consisting of a PEDOT-based material, with the hybrid device, a color gradient between 1 ng/mL and 10 μg/mL of sarcosine was observed. Thus, the device can be used anywhere with access to a light source, completely equipment-free, suitable for point-of-care analysis and capable of detecting sarcosine within a range of clinical interest.',\n","       'A sensitive label-free biosensor based on Ag(2)S-sensitived Bi(2)WO(6)/BiOBr heterojunction for photoelectrochemical immunoassay of prostate specific antigen.Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world, and its early diagnosis can effectively reduce mortality. A new label-free photoelectrochemical (PEC) immunosensor on the basis of Bi(2)WO(6)/BiOBr nanocomposite materials has been successfully prepared for the test of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in human serum in this work.

On Bi(2)WO(6)/BiOBr surface, dopamine immobilized PSA antibody by self-polymerizing to form polydopamine membrane. Antigen and antibody are specifically combined to achieve quantitative detection of PSA according to the current changes at different concentrations of antigen. Under the optimal experimental conditions, the PEC immunosensor has an ideal linear relationship between 1\\xa0pg/mL - 50\\xa0ng/mL, and the detection limit is 0.084\\xa0pg/mL.

In a phase I/II study on de novo metastatic prostate cancer we found that a human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) vaccine induced an early immune response in most of the patients. Here we present the results from the long-term monitoring of the immune responses and clinical outcomes. Twenty-two men with ISUP 4 to 5 and lymph node and/or bone metastases were treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), radiotherapy and the hTERT vaccine UV1 between January 2013 and July 2014. Immune response was monitored before, during and after vaccination and continued every 6 months until PSA progression. All patients had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline, and after 6 months, 1 and 2\\u2009years, and at progression. The clinical outcome was time to progression, overall survival and prostate cancer-specific survival. The median follow-up was 62\\u2009months (range: 19-101).

Six have no progression, two have castration-resistant disease treated with second-line ADT and one has castration-refractory disease. Median time to PSA progression was 21\\u2009months, median overall survival was 62\\u2009months and median prostate cancer-specific survival was 84\\u2009months. Lack of immune response was an independent marker of prostate cancer death. The long-term monitoring showed that some patients had unanticipated subsequent high immune responses without developing recurrence. This association indicates that there might be a clinical benefit of hTERT vaccination in a subgroup of men with primary metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer treated with ADT and radiotherapy.',\n","       \"Histone methyltransferase KMT2D promotes prostate cancer progression through paracrine IL-6 signaling.Histone methyltransferase KMT2D plays a critical role as a human oncogene in prostate cancer (PCa). Dysregulated inflammatory responses and cytokine signaling are implicated in cancer progression. Furthermore, interleukin 6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine that contributes to PCa progression; however, the association between KMT2D and IL-6 in PCa remains unclear. PCa cell proliferative potential, migratory potential, and apoptosis in\\xa0vitro were determined using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), EdU incorporation, wound healing, and apoptosis assays. Proliferation and migratory potential were impaired and apoptosis was induced in PCa cells cultured with the conditioned medium from KMT2D-depleted cells. Cytokine array analysis showed that IL-6 was the most affected cytokine in the conditioned media. KMT2D knockdown significantly downregulated the expression of IL-6 in PCa cells. What's more, proliferation and migration were also impaired and apoptosis was also induced by silencing IL-6R expression. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were performed to validate the positive correlation between KMT2D and IL-6 in PCa tissue samples. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-PCR demonstrated that KMT2D and H3K4me1 occupied IL-6 enhancer regions and therefore, directly regulated IL-6 expression. The present study revealed that the KMT2D knockdown suppressed prostate cancer progression through the downregulation of paracrine IL-6 signaling. These results suggest that KMT2D could be regarded as a potential new target for PCa therapy.\",\n","       'Discovery of a novel 1H-pyrazole inhibitor with potential anti-prostate cancer activity that perturbs the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT pathway.Lysine demethylase 5B (KDM5B) is a member of the Jumonji AT-rich interactive domain 1 family. Its main function is to demethylate di/trimethyl histone H3 lysine 4 and it plays a crucial role in the occurrence and development of cancer. In this study, we performed structure-based optimization of KDM5B inhibitors based on our previous work and the most active compound we synthesized was 11ad. Molecular modeling studies and thermal shift assays revealed that 11ad specifically targets KDM5B at the molecular and cellular levels. Crucially, 11ad demonstrated good pharmacokinetic properties and anti-prostate cancer activity in a xenograft model. Furthermore, unexpectedly, the specificity of 11ad for prostate cancer was found to be related to its inhibition of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT pathway. This is the first report of a KDM5B inhibitor affecting this pathway. Taken together, our findings indicate that 11ad is a novel KDM5B inhibitor that may serve as a lead compound for the development of treatments for prostate cancer.',\n","       \"Isotonic design for phase I cancer clinical trials with late-onset toxicities.This article addresses the problem of identifying the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in Phase I dose-finding clinical trials with late-onset toxicities. The main design challenge is how best to adaptively allocate study participants to tolerable doses when the evaluation window for the toxicity endpoint is long relative to the accrual rate of new participants. We propose a new design framework based on order-restricted statistical inference that addresses this challenge in sequential dose assignments. We illustrate the proposed method on real data from a Phase I trial of bortezomib in lymphoma patients and apply it to a Phase I trial of radiotherapy in prostate cancer patients. We conduct extensive simulation studies to compare our design's operating characteristics to existing published methods. Overall, our proposed design demonstrates good performance relative to existing methods in allocating participants at and around the MTD during the study and accurately recommending the MTD at the study conclusion.\",\n","       'Editorial Comment: Environmental Impact of Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Transrectal Ultrasound Guided Prostate Biopsy.nan',\n","       'Is it necessary for all patients with suspicious lesions undergo systematic biopsy in the era of MRI-TRUS fusion targeted biopsy?PURPOSE: Targeted biopsy (TB) combined with systematic biopsy (SB) is an optimized mode of prostate biopsy but can often lead to oversampling and overdiagnosis accompanied by potential biopsy-related complications and patient discomfort. Here, we attempted to reasonably stratify the patient population based on multi-parameter indicators with the aim of avoiding unnecessary SB. METHODS: In total, 340 biopsy-naïve men with suspected lesions, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) < 20 ng/mL and prostate imaging-reporting and data system (PI-RADS) ≥ 3 enrolled for study underwent both TB and SB. The primary outcome was to determine independent predictors for a valid diagnosis, assuming that only TB was performed and SB omitted (defined as mono-TB), taking TB + SB as the reference standard. The secondary outcomes were exploration of the predictive factors of mono-TB and TB + SB in detection of prostate cancer (PCa) and clinically significant PCa (csPCa). RESULTS: The mean PSA density (PSAD) of patient group was 0.27 ng/mL/mL. Multiparametric MRI PI-RADS scores were 3-5 in 146 (42.94%), 105 (30.88%), and 89 (26.18%) cases, respectively. PCa and csPCa were detected in 178/340 (52.35%) and 162/340 (47.65%) patients, respectively. Overall, 116/178 (65.17%) patients diagnosed with PCa displayed pathological consistencies between mono-TB and TB + SB modes. PSAD and PI-RADS were independent predictors of valid diagnosis using mono-TB. CONCLUSIONS: PSAD combined with PI-RADS showed utility in guiding optimization of the prostate biopsy mode. Higher PSAD and PI-RADS values were associated with greater confidence in implementing mono-TB and safely omitting SB, thus effectively balancing the benefits and risks.',\n","       'Complication rates of transrectal and transperineal prostate fusion biopsies there a learning curve even in high volume interventional center?PURPOSE: To analyze the learning curve regarding complication rates of transrectal prostate biopsy (TRPB) versus transperineal prostate biopsy (TPPB), using real time software-based magnetic resonance imaging ultrasound (MRI-US) fusion techniques, along with first year experience of transperineal approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS: retrospective unicentric cohort study at a quaternary care hospital. Medical records of all consecutive patients that underwent TPPB between March 2021 and February 2022, after the introduction of MRI-US fusion device, and those who underwent TRPB throughout the entire years of 2019 and 2020 were analyzed. All complications that occurred as consequences of the procedure were considered. Descriptive statistics, Chi-squared and Fisher tests were used to describe complications and compare the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 283 patients were included in the transperineal group and 513 in the transrectal group. The analysis of a learning curve for the transperineal method showed lower complications rates comparing the first six months of TPPB procedures (group 1); The complication rate for TPPB was lower than that of TRPB (55.1% versus 81.9%, respectively; p<0.01). TPPB showed specifically lower rates of hematuria (48.8% versus 66.3%;p<0.001) and rectal bleeding(3.5% versus 18.1%; p<0.001). There were no cases of prostatitis after transperineal biopsies and three cases (0.6%) after transrectal procedures. CONCLUSIONS: We evidenced the learning curve for performing the transperineal biopsy, with a lower rate of complications for the experienced team, after 142 cases after 6 months of practice. The lower complication rate of TPPB and the absence of infectious prostatitis imply a safer procedure when compared to TRPB.',\n","       'Effects of In-office Dispensing by Single-specialty Urology Practices on Management of Advanced Prostate Cancer.INTRODUCTION: We examine changes in the volume of patients with advanced prostate cancer and prescriptions for abiraterone and enzalutamide among urology practices with and without in-office dispensing. METHODS: Using data from the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs, we identified in-office dispensing by single-specialty urology practices from 2011 to 2018. As the greatest growth in implementing dispensing occurred among large groups in 2015, outcomes were measured at the practice level in 2014 (before) and 2016 (after) for dispensing and non-dispensing practices. Outcomes included the volume of men with advanced prostate cancer managed by a practice and prescriptions for abiraterone and/or enzalutamide. Using national Medicare data, generalized linear mixed models were fit to compare the practice-level ratio of each outcome (2016 relative to 2014) adjusting for regional contextual factors. RESULTS: In-office dispensing increased from 1% to 30% of single-specialty urology practices from 2011 to 2018, with 28 practices implementing dispensing in 2015. In 2016 compared to 2014, adjusted changes in the volume of patients with advanced prostate cancer managed by a practice were similar between non-dispensing (0.88, 95% CI 0.81-0.94) and dispensing (0.93, 95% CI 0.76-1.09) practices (P = .60). Prescriptions for abiraterone and/or enzalutamide increased in both non-dispensing (2.00, 95% CI 1.58-2.41) and dispensing (8.99, 95% CI 4.51-13.47) practices (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: In-office dispensing is increasingly common in urology practices. This emerging model is not associated with changes in patient volume but is associated with increased prescriptions for abiraterone and enzalutamide.',\n","       '(68)Ga-PSMA PET/CT and Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: Which SUVmax Value?BACKGROUND/AIM: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of (68)Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in the diagnosis and staging of prostate cancer (PCa). PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 2021 to December 2022, 160 men (median age: 66 years) with PCa (median PSA of 11.7 ng/ml) before prostate biopsy underwent (68)Ga-PET/CT imaging examinations (Biograph 6; Siemens, Knoxville, TN, USA). The location of focal uptake on (68)Ga-PSMA PET/TC and standardized uptake values (SUVmax) were reported on a per-lesion basis for each International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade group (GG) PCa. RESULTS: Overall, the median intraprostatic (68)Ga-PSMA SUVmax was 26.1 (range=2.7-164); in the 15 men with not clinically significant PCa (ISUP grade group 1) median SUVmax was 7.5 (range=2.7-12.5). In the 145 men with csPCa (ISUP GG≥2) median SUVmax was 33 (range=7.8-164). A SUVmax cut-off of 8 demonstrated a diagnostic accuracy in the diagnosis of PCa equal to 87.7% vs. 89.3% vs. 100% in the presence of a GG1 vs. GG2 vs. GG≥3 PCa, respectively. In addition, median SUVmax in the bone and node metastases was 52.7 (range=25.3-92.8) and 47 (range=24.5-65), respectively. CONCLUSION: (68)GaPSMA PET/CT with a SUVmax cut-off of 8 demonstrated a good accuracy in the diagnosis of csPCa (100% in the presence of GG≥3) showing a good cost-benefit ratio as a single procedure for the diagnosis and staging of high-risk PCa.',\n","       'Sarcopenia and the Therapeutic Effects of Androgen Receptor-axis-targeted Therapies in Patients With Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.BACKGROUND/AIM: Sarcopenia is a syndrome characterized by the progressive and generalized loss of skeletal muscle mass and has been reported to be a poor prognostic factor for taxane-treated castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, whether sarcopenia affects androgen receptor axis-targeted therapies (ARATs) remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated the association between sarcopenia in CRPC and treatment outcomes of ARATs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 2015 to September 2022, 127 patients who received ARATs as 1st-line treatment for CRPC at our two hospitals were included in the study. We retrospectively evaluated sarcopenia using computed tomography images and investigated whether sarcopenia affects the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with CRPC treated with ARATs. RESULTS: Out of 127 patients, 99 were diagnosed with sarcopenia. The PFS of the sarcopenic group administered ARATs was significantly better than that of the non-sarcopenic group. Furthermore, in the multivariate analysis of PFS, sarcopenia was an independent favourable prognostic factor. However, there was no significant difference in the OS between the sarcopenic and non-sarcopenia groups. CONCLUSION: ARATs could more effectively treat patients with CRPC and sarcopenia than patients with CRPC without sarcopenia. Sarcopenia may positively influence the therapeutic effects of ARATs.',\n","       \"Prevalence and Risk Factors of Emotional Distress in Patients With Prostate Cancer Assigned to External-beam Radiotherapy With or Without High-dose Rate Brachytherapy.BACKGROUND/AIM: Upcoming radiotherapy for prostate cancer may lead to emotional distress. This study aimed to identify the prevalence and risk factors in a retrospective cohort of 102 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirteen characteristics were evaluated for six emotional problems. To account for multiple comparisons, Bonferroni correction was used; p-values <0.0038 were significant (alpha level <0.05). RESULTS: Prevalence of worry, fears, sadness, depression, nervousness, and loss of interest in usual activities was 25%, 27%, 11%, 11%, 18%, and 5%, respectively. A greater number of physical problems was significantly associated with worry (p=0.0037) and fears (p<0.0001) and showed trends regarding sadness (p=0.011) and depression (p=0.011). Trends were also found for associations between younger age and worry (p=0.021), advanced primary tumor stage and fears (p=0.025), patient's history of another malignancy and nervousness (p=0.035), and between external-beam radiotherapy alone and fears (p=0.042) or nervousness (p=0.037). CONCLUSION: Although the prevalence of emotional distress was comparably low, patients with risk factors may benefit from early psychological support.\",\n","       \"Reinforcement of the Tumor Suppressing Properties of microRNA-1 by Substitution at the C2' Position of Varying Ribose Residues in Chemically Synthesized microRNA-1 Molecules.BACKGROUND/AIM: Tumor suppressive microRNAs (miR) are frequently down-regulated during cancer development. The application of synthetic miR molecules restoring suppressed miR, therefore, opens up innovative possibilities in future anticancer therapy. The potential application, however, is limited by the instability of RNA molecules. The presented proof-of-principle study evaluates the potential of using synthetic chemically modified miR molecules as anticancer drugs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chemically synthesized miR-1 molecules containing two 2'-O-RNA modifications, 2'-O-methyl- and 2'-fluoro-derivatives, introduced at different positions of the 3'-terminus, were transfected into prostate cancer (PC) cells (LNCaP, PC-3). Detectability was measured by quantitative RT-PCR. The effect of modifications regarding the growth inhibitory activity of miR-1 was investigated by cell growth kinetics with transfected PC cells. RESULTS: All variants of synthetic modified miR-1 could be transfected into PC cells and were detectable by RT-PCR. Depending on the chemical modification, but especially on the position of the modification, the growth inhibitory activity of synthetic modified miR-1 was increased compared to synthetic unmodified miR-1. CONCLUSION: Synthetic miR-1 can be enhanced in its biological activity by modification of the C2'-OH group. This depends on the chemical substituent, the position and number of substituted nucleotides. The molecular fine-tuning of tumor suppressive miR like miR-1 may represent a promising approach for the development of multi-targeting nucleic acid-based drugs for cancer therapy.\",\n","       \"In Vivo Dosimetry in the Urethra During Prostate Carbon Ion Radiotherapy.BACKGROUND/AIM: In vivo dosimetry can prevent dose delivery errors by directly measuring the dose of radiation administered to a patient. However, a method for in vivo dosimetry during carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) has not been established. Therefore, we investigated data from in vivo dosimetry of the urethra during CIRT for prostate cancer using small spherical diode dosimeters (SSDDs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included five patients enrolled in a clinical trial (jRCT identifier: jRCTs032190180) on which the use of four-fraction CIRT for prostate cancer was examined. The urethral dose during CIRT for prostate cancer was measured using the SSDDs inserted into the ureteral catheter. The relative error between the in vivo and calculated doses obtained using the Xio-N treatment planning system was determined. Additionally, a dose-response stability test for the in vivo dosimeter was performed under clinical conditions. RESULTS: The relative error between the in vivo and calculated urethral doses ranged from 6 to 12%. The dose-response stability under clinical conditions of the measured dose was ≤1%. Therefore, an error >1% would be due to an interfractional patient setup error in the large dose gradient in the urethra. CONCLUSION: The usefulness of in vivo dosimetry using SSDDs in CIRT and SSDDs' potential for detecting dose delivery errors during CIRT is herein highlighted.\",\n","       'Combination of Urinary MiR-501 and MiR-335 With Current Clinical Diagnostic Parameters as Potential Predictive Factors of Prostate Biopsy Outcome.BACKGROUND: The detection of prostate cancer (PCa) is currently based on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) quantification as an initial screening followed by ultrasound-guided transrectal biopsy. However, the high rate of false-negative biopsies often leads to inappropriate treatment. Therefore, new molecular biomarkers, such as urine microRNAs (miRNAs), are a possible way to redefine PCa diagnostics. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Urine samples of 356 patients undergoing prostate biopsy (256 cases with confirmed prostate cancer, 100 cases with negative prostate biopsy) at the Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute (Czech Republic) and additional 36 control subjects (healthy controls, benign prostatic hyperplasia - BPH) were divided into the discovery and validation cohorts and analyzed. In the discovery phase, small RNA sequencing was performed using the QIAseq miRNA Library Kit and the NextSeq 500 platform. Identified miRNA candidates were validated by the RT-qPCR method in the independent validation phase. RESULTS: Using the small RNA sequencing method, we identified 12 urine miRNAs significantly dysregulated between PCa patients and controls. Furthermore, independent validation showed the ability of miR-501-3p and the quantitative miR-335:miR-501 ratio to distinguish between PCa patients and patients with negative prostate biopsy. The subsequent combination of the miR-335:miR-501 ratio with PSA and total prostate volume (TPV) using logistic regression exceeded the analytical accuracy of standalone parameters [area under curve (AUC)=0.75, positive predictive value (PPV)=0.85, negative predictive value (NPV)=0.51)] and discriminated patients according to biopsy outcome. CONCLUSION: Combination of miR-335:miR-501 ratio with PSA and total prostate volume was able to identify patients with negative prostate biopsy and could potentially streamline decision making for biopsy indication.',\n","       'Chromosome-specific segment size alterations are determinants of prognosis in prostate cancer.Currently, risk stratification is the most difficult problem in prostate cancer (PCa) management. Gleason grading cannot adequately predict cancer progression. This study aimed to identify chromosome-specific segment size alterations that could aid risk stratification and predict metastasis using a retrospective cohort-study strategy. A binary logistic regression model was generated using 16 chromosome-specific segments with size alterations (deletions and amplifications) that showed associations with disease stage (primary versus metastatic). The regression model was trained with the MSKCC PIK3R1 PCa cohort (n\\xa0=\\xa01417), and validated with the TCGA Firehose Legacy (n\\xa0=\\xa0500), MSKCC Prostate Oncogenome Project (n\\xa0=\\xa0218), and the SU2C/PCF Dream Team (n\\xa0=\\xa0150) PCa cohorts. Furthermore, the capacity of the model to predict metastasis between primary tumours with metastasis (n\\xa0=\\xa054) and primary tumours without metastasis (n\\xa0=\\xa054) was tested. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the model at disease stage stratification ranged from 69.02% to 88.55%, 72.8% to 86.00% and 66.30% to 89.50%, respectively. The model also showed good performance at metastasis prediction with accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 57.41%, 62.96% and 51.85%, respectively. The study conclusion was that chromosome-specific segment size alterations can aid risk stratification and metastasis prediction. The significance of the study findings is that in combinations with clinical, biochemical, and histopathological variables, chromosome-specific alterations could improve current risk stratification and prediction models for PCa.',\n","       'Prostate Cancer IRE Study (PRIS): A Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Focal Therapy to Radical Treatment in Localized Prostate Cancer.The aim of focal treatments (FTs) in prostate cancer (PCa) is to treat lesions while preserving surrounding benign tissue and anatomic structures. Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a nonthermal technique that uses high-voltage electric pulses to increase membrane permeability and induce membrane disruption in cells, which potentially causes less damage to the surrounding tissue in comparison to other ablative techniques. We summarize the study protocol for the Prostate Cancer IRE Study (PRIS), which involves two parallel randomized controlled trials comparing IRE with (1) robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) or (2) radiotherapy in men with newly diagnosed intermediate-risk PCa (NCT05513443). To reduce the number of patients for inclusion and the study duration, the primary outcomes are functional outcomes: urinary incontinence in study 1 and irritative urinary symptoms in study 2. Providing evidence of the lower impact of IRE on functional outcomes will lay a foundation for the design of future multicenter studies with an oncological outcome as the primary endpoint. Erectile function, quality of life, treatment failure, adverse events, and cost effectiveness will be evaluated as secondary objectives. Patients diagnosed with Gleason score 3 + 4 or 4 + 3 PCa from a single lesion visible on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without any Gleason grade 4 or higher in systematic biopsies outside of the target (unifocal significant disease), aged ≥40 yr, with no established extraprostatic extension on multiparametric MRI, a lesion volume of <1.5 cm(3), prostate-specific antigen <20 ng/ml, and stage ≤T2b are eligible for inclusion.

Expressing chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) in immune cells, typically T lymphocytes, is a practical modification that drives an immune response against cancerous tissue. CAR-T efficacy is suboptimal in solid tumors due to the tumor microenvironment (TME) that limits T lymphocyte cytotoxicity. In this study, we demonstrate that neutrophils differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells modified with AAVS1-inserted CAR constructs showed a robust cytotoxic effect against prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expressing LNCaP cells as a model for prostate cancer in vitro.

The aim of this study is to develop a convolutional neural networks-based framework for fully-automated detection and segmentation of metastatic prostate cancer lesions in whole-body PET/CT images. METHODS: 525 whole-body PET/CT images of patients with metastatic prostate cancer were available for the study, acquired with the [(18)F]DCFPyL radiotracer that targets prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). U-Net (1)-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were trained to identify lesions on paired axial PET/CT slices. Baseline models were trained using batch-wise dice loss, as well as the proposed weighted batch-wise dice loss (wDice), and the lesion detection performance was quantified, with a particular emphasis on lesion size, intensity, and location. We used 418 images for model training, 30 for model validation, and 77 for model testing. In addition, we allowed our model to take n\\xa0=\\xa00,2, …, 12 neighboring axial slices to examine how incorporating greater amounts of 3D context influences model performance. We selected the optimal number of neighboring axial slices that maximized the detection rate on the 30 validation images, and trained five neural networks with different architectures. RESULTS: Model performance was evaluated using the detection rate, Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and sensitivity. We found that the proposed wDice loss significantly improved the lesion detection rate, lesion-wise DSC and lesion-wise sensitivity compared to the baseline, with corresponding average increases of 0.07 (p-value\\xa0=\\xa00.01), 0.03 (p-value\\xa0=\\xa00.01) and 0.04 (p-value\\xa0=\\xa00.01), respectively. The inclusion of the first two neighboring axial slices in the input likewise increased the detection rate by 0.17, lesion-wise DSC by 0.05, and lesion-wise mean sensitivity by 0.16. However, there was a minimal effect from including more distant neighboring slices. We ultimately chose to use a number of neighboring slices equal to 2 and the wDice loss function to train our final model. To evaluate the model's performance, we trained three models using identical hyperparameters on three different data splits. The results showed that, on average, the model was able to detect 80% of all testing lesions, with a detection rate of 93% for lesions with maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) greater than 5.0. In addition, the average median lesion-wise DSC was 0.51 and 0.60 for all the lesions and lesions with SUVmax>5.0, respectively, on the testing set. Four additional neural networks with different architectures were trained, and they both yielded stronger performance of segmenting lesions whose SUVmax>5.0 compared to the rest of lesions. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that prostate cancer metastases in PSMA PET/CT images can be detected and segmented using CNNs. The segmentation performance strongly depends on the intensity, size, and the location of lesions, and can be improved by using specialized loss functions. Specifically, the models performed best in detection of lesions with SUVmax>5.0. Another challenge was to accurately segment lesions close to the bladder. Future work will focus on improving the detection of lesions with lower SUV values by designing custom loss functions that take into account the lesion intensity, using additional data augmentation techniques, and reducing the number of false lesions by developing methods to better separate signal from noise.\",\n","       'Prostate adenocarcinoma metastasis to the testis: A new case report.Prostate cancer (PCa) in the second most common cancer in men worldwide.

METHODS: Men enrolled in the IMPACT study provided serum samples during regular visits. Hormonal levels were calculated using immunoassays. Free testosterone (FT) was calculated from TT and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) using the Sodergard mass equation. Age, body mass index (BMI), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and hormonal concentrations were compared between genetic cohorts. We also explored associations between age and TT, SHBG, FT and PCa, in the whole subset and stratified by BRCA1/2 PVs status. RESULTS: A total of 777 participants in the IMPACT study had TT and SHBG measurements in serum samples at annual visits, giving 3940 prospective androgen levels, from 266 BRCA1 PVs carriers, 313 BRCA2 PVs carriers and 198 non-carriers. The median number of visits per patient was 5. There was no difference in TT, SHBG and FT between carriers and non-carriers. In a univariate analysis, androgen levels were not associated with PCa. In the analysis stratified by carrier status, no significant association was found between hormonal levels and PCa in non-carriers, BRCA1 or BRCA2 PVs carriers. CONCLUSIONS: Male BRCA1/2 PVs carriers have a similar androgen profile to non-carriers. Hormonal levels were not associated with PCa in men with and without BRCA1/2 PVs. Mechanisms related to the particularly aggressive phenotype of PCa in BRCA2 PVs carriers may therefore not be linked with circulating hormonal levels.',\n","       \"Impact of prebiopsy MRI on prostate cancer staging: Results from the Norwegian Prostate Cancer Registry.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to evaluate the 2015 introduction of prebiopsy magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate (MRI-P) as the standard of care for diagnosing prostate cancer (PCa) by the Norwegian public health care authorities. There were three specific objectives of this study: first, to evaluate the consequences of using different TNM manuals for clinical T-staging (cT-staging) in a national setting; second, to determine if the data reveals that MRI-P based cT-staging is superior to digital rectal examination (DRE)-based cT-staging compared with pathological T-stage (pT-stage) post radical prostatectomy; and third, to assess whether treatment allocations have changed over time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients registered in the Norwegian Prostate Cancer Registry between 2004 and 2021 were retrieved and 5538 were eligible for inclusion. Concordance between clinical T-stage (cT-stage) and pT-stage was assessed by percentage agreement, Cohen's kappa and Gwet's agreement. RESULTS: MR visualisation of lesions influences reporting of tumour extension beyond DRE findings. Agreement between cT-stage and pT-stage declined from 2004 to 2009, which coincided with an increase in the percentage being pT3. From 2010, agreement increased, which aligned with changes in cT-staging and the introduction of MRI-P. From 2017, regarding the reporting of cT-DRE and cT-Total (overall cT-stage), agreement diminished for cT-DRE but remained relatively stable (>60%) for cT-Total. Regarding treatment allocation, the study suggests that staging with MRI-P has shifted treatment towards radiotherapy in locally advanced high-risk disease. CONCLUSION: Introduction of MRI-P has affected cT-stage reporting. Agreement between cT-stage and pT-stage appears to have improved. This study suggests that use of MRI-P influences treatment decisions in certain patient subgroups.\",\n","       'Diagnostic and cost-effectiveness of axial skeleton MRI in staging high-risk prostate cancer.INTRODUCTION: Current literature suggests that axial skeleton magnetic resonance imaging (AS-MRI) is more sensitive than Tc 99m bone scintigraphy (BS) for detecting bone metastases (BM) in high-risk prostate cancer (PCa). However, BS is still widely performed. Its diagnostic accuracy has been studied; however, its feasibility and cost implications are yet to be examined. METHODS: We reviewed all patients with high risk PCa undergoing AS-MRI over a 5-year period. AS-MRI was performed on patients with histologically confirmed PCa and either PSA\\u2009>\\u200920\\u2009ng/ml, Gleason ≥8, or TNM Stage ≥T3 or N1 disease. All AS-MRI studies were obtained using a 1.5-T AchievaPhilips™MRI scanner. We compared the AS-MRI positivity and equivocal rate with that of BS. Data were analysed according to Gleason score, T-stage and PSA. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to quantify the strength of association between positive scans and clinical variables. Feasibility and burden of expenditure was also evaluated. RESULTS: Five hundred three patients with a median age of 72 and a mean PSA of 34.8\\xa0ng/ml were analysed. Eighty-eight patients (17.5%) were positive for BM on AS-MRI (mean PSA 99 [95% CI 69.1-129.9]). Comparatively 409 patients (81.3%) were negative for BM on AS-MRI (mean PSA 24.7 (95% CI [21.7-27.7]) (p\\u2009=\\u20090.007); 1.2% (n\\u2009=\\u20096) of patients had equivocal results (mean PSA 33.4 [95% CI 10.5-56.3]). There was no significant difference in age (p\\u2009=\\u20090.122) between this group and patients with a positive scan, but there was a significant difference in PSA (p\\u2009=\\u20090.028), T stage (p\\u2009=\\u20090.006) and Gleason score (p\\u2009=\\u20090.023). In comparison with BS, AS-MRI detection rate was equivalent or higher compared with the literature. Based on NHS tariff calculations, there would be a minimum cost saving of £8406.89. All patients underwent AS-MRI within 14\\u2009days. CONCLUSION: The use of AS-MRI to stage BM in high-risk PCa is both feasible and results in a reduced burden of expenditure.',\n","       'Stratifying the initial prostate cancer suspicion to avoid magnetic resonance exams by sequencing men according to serum prostate-specific antigen, digital rectal examination and the prostate-specific antigen density based on digital rectal prostate volume category.nan',\n","       \"Clinical outcomes of anterior prostate cancers treated with robotic assisted radical prostatectomy.INTRODUCTION: A prospective cohort study comparing peri outcomes for patients with predominantly anterior prostate cancer (APC) identified preoperatively against non-anterior prostate cancer (NAPC) treated via robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of the 757 RARP's completed between January 2016 and April 2018, two comparative cohorts for anterior and an equivalent group of non-anterior prostate tumours each consisting of 152 patients were compared against each other. Data were collected on the following variables: patient age; operating consultant; preoperative PSA, ISUP grade, degree of nerve sparing; tumour staging; presence and location of positive surgical margins; PSA density, postoperative ISUP grade; treatment paradigm and postoperative PSA, erectile function, and continence outcomes with 2-year follow-up. RESULTS: APCs were found to have significantly lower ISUP grading postoperatively; increased diagnosis via active surveillance over new diagnosis; more frequently undertaken bilateral nerve-sparing and long-term poorer continence outcomes at 18 and 24\\u2009months postoperatively (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Pre- and post-op PSA levels, erectile function, PSA density, positive surgical margins (PSM), age and tumour staging showed no significant differences between the APC and NAPC cohorts (p\\u2009>\\u20090.05). CONCLUSION: The lower ISUP grading could indicate APC as overall being less aggressive than NAPC, whereas the poorer long-term continence outcomes require further investigating. The non-significant differences amongst tumour staging, PSA density, preoperative PSA levels and PSM rates suggest that APC may not be as significant as predicted in diagnostic evaluation. Overall, this study provides useful information on the growing literature of anterior prostate cancer. Being the largest comparative cohort study to date on APC post-RARP, these results indicate the true characteristics of anterior tumours and their functional outcomes to help improve education, patient expectations and management.\",\n","       'Genomic alterations in neuroendocrine prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.BACKGROUND: Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is a lethal subtype of prostate cancer. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the prevalence of genomic alterations in NEPC and better understand its molecular features to potentially inform precision medicine. METHODS: EMBASE, PubMed, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched for eligible studies until March 2022. Study qualities were assessed using the Q-genie tool. The prevalence of gene mutations and copy number alterations (CNAs) were extracted, and meta-analysis was performed using R Studio with meta package. RESULTS: A total of 14 studies with 449 NEPC patients were included in this meta-analysis. The most frequently mutated gene in NEPC was TP53 (49.8%), and the prevalence of deleterious mutations in ATM/BRCA was 16.8%. Common CNAs in NEPC included RB1 loss (58.3%), TP53 loss (42.8%), PTEN loss (37.0%), AURKA amplification (28.2%), and MYCN amplification (22.9%). RB1/TP53 alterations and concurrent RB1 and TP53 alterations were remarkably common in NEPC, with a prevalence of 83.8% and 43.9%, respectively. Comparative analyses indicated that the prevalence of (concurrent) RB1/TP53 alterations was significantly higher in de novo NEPC than in treatment-emergent NEPC (t-NEPC). CONCLUSIONS: This study presents the comprehensive prevalence of common genomic alterations and potentially actionable targets in NEPC and reveals the genomic differences between de novo NEPC and t-NEPC. Our findings highlight the importance of genomic testing in patients for precision medicine and provide insights into future studies exploring different NEPC subtypes.',\n","       'MRI of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: Important Pre Considerations.New minimally invasive techniques that reduce morbidity while improving lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) have become attractive alternatives for patients, in comparison to traditional techniques such as transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and simple prostatectomy. Pre- and postprocedural MRI is not routinely performed for LUTS due to BPH treatments. However, because of the combination of rapidly evolving treatments available for LUTS due to BPH and increasing demand for prebiopsy prostate MRI for detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (PCa), an understanding of procedural techniques and expected changes are important for accurate interpretation of prostate MRI performed after treatment of BPH. The authors discuss the imaging evaluation of LUTS due to BPH and emerging predictors of treatment success. The posttreatment appearance and underlying anatomic changes in the prostate after medical, surgical, and minimally invasive treatments including TURP, simple prostatectomy, laser enucleations and ablations, prostatic urethral lift, water vapor thermal therapy, and prostate artery embolization are detailed. Most procedures reduce prostate volume, notably in the periurethral prostatic tissue. Ablations create areas of necrosis and can distort the normal zonal anatomy between the transition zone and the peripheral zone, and prostate artery embolization creates infarcts in the transition zone. Mechanical prostatic urethral lift devices open the anterior channel at the bladder base but create susceptibility artifacts that can obscure and prevent detection of a lesion in the transition zone. Also discussed are the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer in the postprocedural prostate and imaging of BPH procedure complications such as urethral strictures, abscesses, and hematuria.

The presence of HP1α, also known as the heterochromatin protein 1α, is required for the creation of higher-order chromatin structures. However, little is known about HP1α that serves roles in the pathogenesis of PCa. The primary purpose of our research was to investigate alterations in the levels of HP1α expression and to plan a series of tests to validate the function of HP1α in PCa. METHOD: Information on HP1α expression in PCa and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissues were gathered using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) databases. RT-qPCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to assess HP1α mRNA and protein expression in several human PCa tissues and cell lines. The CCK8 assay, clone formation assay, and transwell assay were used to examine biological activities including cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. The expression of proteins connected to apoptosis and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was examined using Western blot. The tumorigenic effect of HP1α was also verified by in vivo experiments. RESULT: HP1α expression was much higher in PCa than in BPH tissues and cells, and was positively correlated with the Gleason score of PCa. In vitro experiments showed that HP1α knockdown could inhibit the ability of proliferation, invasion, and migration of PC3 and LNCaP cells, and promote cell apoptosis and EMT. In vivo experiments showed that HP1α knockdown inhibited tumorigenesis in mice. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that HP1α expression promotes PCa development and might be a novel therapeutic target for the diagnosis or treatment of PCa.',\n","       \"Current thoughts on cellular functions of numb-associated kinases.Members of the Numb-associated kinase family of serine/threonine kinases play an essential role in many cellular processes, such as endocytosis, autophagy, dendrite morphogenesis, osteoblast differentiation, and the regulation of the Notch pathway. Numb-associated kinases have been relevant to diverse diseases, including neuropathic pain, Parkinson's disease, and prostate cancer. Therefore, they are considered potential therapeutic targets. In addition, it is reported that Numb-associated kinases have been involved in the life cycle of multiple viruses such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), Ebola virus (EBOV), and dengue virus (DENV). Recently, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to threaten global health. Studies show that Numb-associated kinases are implicated in the infection of SARS-CoV-2 which can be suppressed by Numb-associated kinases inhibitors. Thus, Numb-associated kinases are proposed as potential host targets for broad-spectrum antiviral strategies. We will focus on the recent advances in Numb-associated kinases-related cellular functions and their potential as host targets for viral infections in this review. Questions that remained unknown on the cellular functions of Numb-associated kinases will also be discussed.\",\n","       'Test-retest repeatability of ADC in prostate using the multi b-Value VERDICT acquisition.PURPOSE: VERDICT (Vascular, Extracellular, Restricted Diffusion for Cytometry in Tumours) MRI is a multi b-value, variable diffusion time DWI sequence that allows generation of ADC maps from different b-value and diffusion time combinations. The aim was to assess precision of prostate ADC measurements from varying b-value combinations using VERDICT and determine which protocol provides the most repeatable ADC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-one men (median age: 67.7\\xa0years) from a prior prospective VERDICT study (April 2016-October 2017) were analysed retrospectively. Men who were suspected of prostate cancer and scanned twice using VERDICT were included. ADC maps were formed using 5b-value combinations and the within-subject standard deviations (wSD) were calculated per ADC map. Three anatomical locations were analysed per subject: normal TZ (transition zone), normal PZ (peripheral zone), and index lesions. Repeated measures ANOVAs showed which b-value range had the lowest wSD, Spearman correlation and generalized linear model regression analysis determined whether wSD was related to ADC magnitude and ROI size. RESULTS: The mean lesion ADC for b(0)b(1500) had the lowest wSD in most zones (0.18-0.58x10(-4) mm(2)/s). The wSD was unaffected by ADC magnitude (Lesion: p\\xa0=\\xa00.064, TZ: p\\xa0=\\xa00.368, PZ: p\\xa0=\\xa00.072) and lesion Likert score (p\\xa0=\\xa00.95). wSD showed a decrease with ROI size pooled over zones (p\\xa0=\\xa00.019, adjusted regression coefficient\\xa0=\\xa0-1.6x10(-3), larger ROIs for TZ versus PZ versus lesions). ADC maps formed with a maximum b-value of 500\\xa0s/mm(2) had the largest wSDs (1.90-10.24x10(-4) mm(2)/s). CONCLUSION: ADC maps generated from b(0)b(1500) have better repeatability in normal TZ, normal PZ, and index lesions.',\n","       'Effective drug combinations of betulinic acid and ceranib-2 loaded Zn:MnO(2) doped-polymeric nanocarriers against PC-3 prostate cancer cells.The development of theranostic nanocarriers with synergistic drug combinations has received considerable attention due to their improved pharmaceutical activity. Herein, we reported an investigation about the in-vitro anticancer activity of ceranib-2 (Cer), betulinic acid (BA), and the combination of betulinic acid and ceranib-2 (BA-Cer) against PC-3 prostate cancer cells. For this purpose, first we designed a suitable nanocarrier using a novel Zn:MnO(2) nanocomposite (NCs) and gallic acid (GA)-polylactic acid (PLA)-Alginate polymeric shell with nanoscale particle size and good stability. Chemical statements, morphology, and physicochemical properties of the nanocarrier have been illuminated with advanced characterization techniques. According to the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results, Zn:MnO(2) NCs had a spherical and monodispersed morphology with a 2.03\\xa0±\\xa00.67\\xa0nm diameter. Moreover, vibrating-sample magnetometer (VSM) results showed that Zn:MnO(2) had paramagnetic properties with a saturation magnetization (Ms) value of 1.136\\xa0emu/g. Additionally, the in-vitro cytotoxic effects of the single and binary drugs loaded Zn:MnO(2)-doped polymeric nanocarriers against PC-3 prostate cancer cells were investigated. According to the results, there was no significant cytotoxic effect of free BA and Cer against PC-3 prostate cancer cells. However, BA/Zn:MnO(2)@GA-PLA-Alginate NCs, BA-Cer/Zn:MnO(2) @GA-PLA-Alginate NCs and free BA-Cer had IC(50) values of 6.498, 7.351, and 18.571\\xa0μg/mL, respectively. Consequently, BA-Cer/Zn:MnO(2)@GA-PLA-Alginate is a nanocarrier with good stability, enhanced drug loading and release capacity for hydrophobic drugs, as well as being used as both imaging and treatment agent due to its magnetic properties. Furthermore, BA and Cer drug combination showed great promise in prostate cancer therapy which is known to be resulted high drug resistance. We strongly believed that this work could lead to an investigation of the molecular mechanisms of BA-mediated cancer theapy.',\n","       'A semi-automated software program to assess the impact of second reads in prostate MRI for equivocal lesions: results from a UK tertiary referral centre.PURPOSE: To investigate the utility of a prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) second read using a semi-automated software program in the one-stop clinic, where patients undergo multiparametric MRI, review and biopsy planning in one visit. We looked at concordance between readers for patients with equivocal scans and the possibility for biopsy deferral in this group. METHODS: We present data from 664 consecutive patients. Scans were reported by seven different expert genitourinary radiologists using dedicated software (MIM®) and a Likert scale. All scans were rescored by another expert genitourinary radiologist using a customised workflow for second reads that includes annotated biopsy contours for accurate visual targeting. The number of scans in which a biopsy could have been deferred using biopsy results and prostate specific antigen density was assessed. Gleason score\\xa0≥\\xa03\\xa0+\\xa04 was considered clinically significant disease. Concordance between first and second reads for equivocal scans (Likert 3) was evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 209/664 (31%) patients scored Likert 3 on first read, 128 of which (61%) were concordant after second read. 103/209 (49%) of patients with Likert 3 scans were biopsied, with clinically significant disease in 31 (30%) cases. Considering Likert 3 scans that were both downgraded and biopsied using the workflow-generated biopsy contours, 25/103 (24%) biopsies could have been deferred. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing a semi-automated workflow for accurate lesion contouring and targeting biopsies is helpful during the one-stop clinic. We observed a reduction of indeterminate scans after second reading and almost a quarter of biopsies could have been deferred, reducing the potential biopsy-related side effects.',\n","       'Comprehensive evaluation of surrogate endpoints to predict overall survival in trials with PD1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors plus chemotherapy.BACKGROUND: PD1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have revolutionized cancer treatment. Although there is controversy about the accuracy of surrogate endpoints in the ICI setting to predict overall survival (OS), these endpoints are commonly used in confirmatory trials. Here we aimed to explore the validity of classical and novel surrogate endpoints in randomised controlled trials (RCT) that combine ICI plus chemotherapy (CT) in the first-line setting. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to identify RCT investigating anti-PD1/PD-L1 drugs plus CT versus CT alone. We performed (i) arm-level analysis to evaluate predictors of median OS (mOS) and (ii) comparison-level analysis for OS hazard ratio (HR) estimations. Linear regression models weighted by trial size were fitted and adjusted R(2) values were reported. RESULTS: Thirty-nine RCTs involving 22,341 patients met the inclusion criteria (17 non-small cell lung, 9 gastroesophageal and 13 in other cancers) with ten different ICI under study. Overall, ICI plus CT improved OS (HR\\xa0=\\xa00.76; 95%CI: 0.73-0.80). In the arm-level analysis, the best mOS prediction was obtained with a new endpoint that combines median duration of response and ORR (mDoR-ORR) and with median PFS (R(2)\\xa0=\\xa00.5 both). In the comparison-level analysis, PFS HR showed a moderate association with OS HR (R(2)\\xa0=\\xa00.52). Early OS read-outs were highly associated with final OS outcomes (R(2)\\xa0=\\xa00.80). CONCLUSIONS: The association between surrogate endpoints and OS in first-line RCT combining anti-PD1/PD-L1 and CT is moderate-low. Early OS read-outs showed a good association with final OS HR while the mDOR-ORR endpoint could help to better design confirmatory trials after single-arm phase II trials.',\n","       'MFA-Net: Multiple Feature Association Network for medical image segmentation.Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in computer-aided diagnosis. However, due to the large variability of medical images, accurate segmentation is a highly challenging task. In this paper, we present a novel medical image segmentation network named the Multiple Feature Association Network (MFA-Net), which is based on deep learning techniques. The MFA-Net utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections as its backbone network, and a parallelly dilated convolutions arrangement (PDCA) module is integrated between the encoder and the decoder to capture more representative deep features. Furthermore, a multi-scale feature restructuring module (MFRM) is introduced to restructure and fuse the deep features of the encoder. To enhance global attention perception, the proposed global attention stacking (GAS) modules are cascaded on the decoder. The proposed MFA-Net leverages novel global attention mechanisms to improve the segmentation performance at different feature scales. We evaluated our MFA-Net on four segmentation tasks, including lesions in intestinal polyp, liver tumor, prostate cancer, and skin lesion. Our experimental results and ablation study demonstrate that the proposed MFA-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of global positioning and local edge recognition.',\n","       'Acute and late toxicity patterns of moderate hypo-fractionated radiotherapy for prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.INTRODUCTION: Moderate hypofractionated (HF) radiotherapy is becoming the new standard in radiotherapy for prostate cancer patients. It is established as safe, but it might be associated with increased acute toxicity levels. We conducted a systematic review on moderate HF to establish acute toxicity levels and their required clinical management; late toxicity was reported as a secondary outcome. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review for studies published until June 2022. We identified 17 prospective studies, with 7796 localised prostate cancer patients, reporting acute toxicity of moderate hypofractionation (2.5-3.4\\xa0Gy/fraction). A meta-analysis was done for 10/17 studies with a control arm (standard fractionation (SF)), including evaluation of late toxicity rates. We used Cochrane bias assessment and Newcastle-Ottawa bias assessment tools for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) RCT and non-RCTs, respectively. RESULTS: Pooled results showed that acute grade\\xa0≥\\xa02 gastro-intestinal (GI) toxicity was increased by 6.3\\xa0% (95\\xa0% CI for risk difference\\xa0=\\xa02.0\\xa0%-10.6\\xa0%) for HF vs SF. Acute grade\\xa0≥\\xa02 Genito-urinary (GU) and late toxicity were not significantly increased. The overall risk of bias assessment revealed a low risk in the meta-analysis of included studies. Data on management of toxicity (medication, interventions) was only reported in 2/17 studies. CONCLUSION: HF is associated with increased acute GI symptoms, needing adequate monitoring and management. Reports on toxicity management were very limited. Pooled late GI and GU toxicity showed similar levels for SF and HF.',\n","       'Clinical Impact of a Rapid Genetic Testing Model for Advanced Prostate Cancer Patients.PURPOSE: Genetic testing may alter clinical management for individuals with metastatic prostate cancer by identifying additional therapies. Traditional counseling models are unlikely to enable time-sensitive therapeutic decision-making. This study aimed to determine the feasibility and clinical impact of an alternative hereditary genetic testing model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: As part of a multicenter, single-arm prospective trial, individuals with advanced prostate cancer were referred by their oncologist for testing of 14 genes associated with hereditary prostate cancer. Pretest education (brochure and video) was provided in the oncology clinic. Questionnaires assessing participant satisfaction with both pretest education and decision to undergo genetic testing were collected. A genetic counselor contacted participants by phone to obtain family history and discuss results. Medical records were queried to determine whether a change in clinical management was discussed. RESULTS: Of 501 participants consented to germline analysis, 51 (10.2%) had at least 1 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant. Change in treatment was discussed with 22/48 (45.8%) of eligible participants who tested positive. Feasibility of this model was assessed by participant satisfaction and turnaround time. Average±SD satisfaction with the pretest education (15.5±2.2, 4-20 scale) and with the decision to undergo genetic testing (17.1±2.9, 4-20 scale) were both high. Results were returned 20 days (median) after sample collection. CONCLUSIONS: Oncologist-initiated germline genetic testing in collaboration with a genetic counselor is a feasible approach to testing advanced prostate cancer patients with impactful clinical actionability. The testing model and educational material serve as resources to clinicians treating prostate cancer patients.',\n","       'Randomized phase II trial in prostate cancer with hormone-sensitive OligometaSTatic relapse: Combining stereotactic ablative radiotherapy and durvalumab (POSTCARD GETUG P13): Study protocol.BACKGROUND: As in other solid tumors, increasing evidence indicates that patients diagnosed with a limited number of prostate cancer metastases, so-called oligometastases, have a better prognosis than patients with extensive metastatic disease. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is now considered an option in this population.Programmed death-1 (PD-1) and its ligands (PD-L1) are targeted by immune checkpoint inhibitors. Preclinical studies have shown that the tumor immune microenvironment changes when combining radiotherapy with immunotherapy, especially with hypofractionated radiotherapy.The oligometastatic setting appears to be the most relevant clinical situation for evaluating the immune response generated by radiotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with an intact immune system.We hypothesize that durvalumab will enhance the immune response following SBRT targeting oligometastatic lesions. Our purpose is to demonstrate, via a randomized 2:1 phase II trial, that SBRT (3 fractions) with durvalumab in oligometastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer patients would improve progression-free survival in patients with prostate cancer with up to 5 metastases compared to patients who exclusively received SBRT. METHODS: This is a multicentric randomized phase II study in French academic hospitals. Patients with prostate cancer and up to 5 metastases (lymph node and/or bone) were randomized into a 2:1 ratio between Arm A (experimental group), corresponding to durvalumab and SBRT to the metastases, and Arm B (control group), corresponding to SBRT alone to the metastases. The study aims to accrue a total of 96 patients within 3\\xa0years. The primary endpoint is two-year progression-free survival and secondary endpoints include androgen deprivation therapy-free survival, quality of life, toxicity, prostate cancer specific survival, overall survival, and immune response. DISCUSSION: The expected benefit for the patients in the experimental arm is longer life expectancy with acceptable toxicity. We also expect our study to provide data for better understanding the synergy between immunotherapy and radiotherapy in oligometastatic prostate cancer.',\n","       'T1 mapping of the prostate using Single-Shot T1FLASH and MOLLI MRI Techniques: Comparison of artifact burden and image quality.PURPOSE: To assess artifact burden and image quality of different MRI T1 mapping techniques of the prostate. METHODS: Participants with suspected prostate cancer (PCa) were prospectively enrolled from June-October 2022 and examined with multiparametric prostate MRI (mpMRI; 3\\xa0T scanner; T1wi, T2wi, DWI und DCE). T1 mapping was performed before and after administration of gadolinium-based contrast-agent (GBCA) using (i) a modified Look-Locker inversion (MOLLI) technique and (ii) a novel single-shot T1FLASH inversion recovery technique. T2wi, DWI, T1FLASH and MOLLI sequences were systematically examined regarding prevalence of artifacts and image quality using a 5-point Likert-Scale. RESULTS: A total of n\\xa0=\\xa0100 patients were included (median age: 68\\xa0years). T1FLASH maps (pre-and post-GBCA) showed metal artifacts in 7% of cases and susceptibility artifacts in 1%. For MOLLI maps, pre-GBCA metal and susceptibility artifacts were documented in 6.5% of cases each. MOLLI maps post-GBCA showed artifacts in 59% of cases resulting primarily from urinary GBCA excretion and GBCA accumulation at the bladder base (p\\xa0<\\xa00.01 versus T1FLASH post-GBCA). Image quality for T1FLASH pre-GBCA was rated at a mean 4.9+/-0.4 and for MOLLI at 4.8+/-0.6 (p\\xa0=\\xa00.14). Post-GBCA image quality was rated at a mean 4.9+/-0.4 for T1FLASH and at 3.7+/-1.1 for MOLLI (p\\xa0<\\xa00.001). CONCLUSIONS: T1FLASH maps provide a fast and robust method for quantification of T1 relaxation times of the prostate. T1FLASH is suitable for T1 mapping of the prostate following administration of contrast agents, while MOLLI T1 mapping is impaired through GBCA accumulation at the bladder base leading to severe image artifacts and reduced image quality.',\n","       'Clinical value of minimum apparent diffusion coefficient for prediction of clinically significant prostate cancer in the transition zone.BACKGROUND: This study investigated the association between apparent diffusion coefficients in Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System 4/5 lesions and clinically significant prostate cancer in the transition zone. METHODS: We included 102 patients who underwent transperineal cognitive fusion targeted biopsy for Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System 4/5 lesions in the transition zone between 2016 and 2020. The association between apparent diffusion coefficients and prostate cancers in the transition zone was analyzed. RESULTS: The detection rate of prostate cancer was 49% (50/102), including clinically significant prostate cancer in 37.3% (38/102) of patients. The minimum apparent diffusion coefficients in patients with clinically significant prostate cancer were 494.5\\u2009±\\u2009133.6 µm(2)/s, which was significantly lower than 653.8\\u2009±\\u2009172.5 µm(2)/s in patients with benign histology or clinically insignificant prostate cancer. Age, prostate volume, transition zone volume, and mean and minimum apparent diffusion coefficients were associated with clinically significant prostate cancer. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that only the minimum apparent diffusion coefficient value (odds ratio: 0.994; p\\u2009<\\u20090.001) was an independent predictor of clinically significant prostate cancer. When the cutoff value of the minimum apparent diffusion coefficient was less than 595\\xa0µm(2)/s, indicating the presence of prostate cancer in the transition zone, the detection rate increased to 59.2% (29/49) in this cohort. CONCLUSION: The minimum apparent diffusion coefficient provided additional value to indicate the presence of clinically significant prostate cancer in the transition zone. It may help consider the need for subsequent biopsies in patients with Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System 4/5 lesions and an initial negative targeted biopsy.'],\n","
